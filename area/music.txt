Teenage FBI~
Someone tell me why I do the things 
That I don't wanna do 
When you're around me I'm somebody else 
Someone tell me why I act like a fool 
When things don't go my way 
When you're around me I'm somebody else

There is good reason I guess 
Having once gone too far 
When you clean out the hive 
Does it make you want to cry 
Are you still being followed by the teenage FBI

Someone tell me why 
Someone tell me why 
Someone tell me why I do the things 
That I don't wanna do 
When you're around me I'm somebody else 
Someone tell me why 
Someone tell me why 
Someone tell me why

Temptation Waits~
I'll tell you something
I am a wolf but 
I like to wear sheep's clothing
I am a bonfire
I am a vampire
I'm waiting for my moment

You come on like a drug
I just can't get enough
I'm like an addict coming at you 
For a little more
And there's so much at stake
I can't afford to waste 
I never needed anybody like this before

I'll tell you something
I am a demon
Some say my biggest weakness
I have my reasons
Call it my defense
Be careful what you're wishing

You are a secret
A new possession
I like to keep you guessing

When I'm not sure what I'm living for
When I'm not sure what I'm looking for

Strong~
I'll be right along
Cause baby you're so
Strong...

Baby I see - You're vulnerable to me
That's your power over me

Baby, baby, I know - It's always been so
Physical love is oh so meaningful for you

You write love letters to me - strong
You know how to talk to me - so strong

Baby, I'm yours - you know
Because you're so, so strong

You would fight for me
You would starve for me
You would suffer for me
You would die for me
Well, I feel the same way too
You know I feel that way about you

I know you're mad about me
You've shown me because you're so, so strong

I Quit~
There was a time when 
I would go walking backwards
Round the world if you said you're mine
And I'd run blindfold down the
Kings Road Monday morning
If you'd just for once arrive on time
But you turned into another liar
And you came on like a new Messiah
So before you say what you desire
I'm telling you now?

I Quit! I Quit! 
'Cos loving you's a job I don't need
Ain't gonna go to work no more
I Quit! I Quit! 
The situation's vacant for me
Ain't gonna go to work no more
Ain't gonna go to work no more
Ain't gonna go to work

I got my hands dirty whole you rolled cigarettes
With one eye on the time
I tried my hardest, I've been conscientious
But I'm taking back that heart of mine
You can't roll me round your tongue no more baby
It's time to clear up your emotional debris
And if I'm falling overboard, please don't save me
'Cos I'm telling you now?

I Quit! I Quit! 
'Cos loving you's a job I don't need
Ain't gonna go to work no more
I Quit! I Quit! 
The situation's vacant for me
Ain't gonna go to work no more
Ain't gonna go to work no more
Ain't gonna go to work

It's too late to say you're sorry

You're just like every other lover
A shot rings out and you go running for cover
And I'm so sorry that I can't be your mother
And I'm telling you now?

I Quit! I Quit! 
'Cos loving you's a job I don't need
Ain't gonna go to work no more
I Quit! I Quit! 
The situation's vacant for me
Ain't gonna go to work no more
Ain't gonna go to work no more
Ain't gonna go to work

I Quit! I Quit! I Quit! I Quit! I Quit! I Quit! 
Ain't gonna go to work no more
Ain't gonna go to work no more
Ain't gonna go to work

Over My Head~
I lost an island in the ocean 
The place where nickels come to gamble on their faces 
She took the offer to be the daughter 
We pledge allengiance to the one who affers social graces 

Please don't blame me 
Please don't blame me 

'Cause I'm in over my head, 
In over my head 
It's for the best 

I ripped up the picture 
The one in the kitchen 
I looked weak my eyes they gave it all away 
I don't deny it 
I still haven't found it 
I proudly wear the scars 
I've challenged every crutch so far 

Please don't blame me 
Please don't blame me 
'Cause I'm in over my head, in over my head 
It's for the best and I'm in over my head, in over my head 
It's for the best, It's for the best, It's for the best

Lucky~
it was a monday, when my lover told me, 
"never pay the reaper with love only." 
what could i say to you, except, "i love you." 
and "i'd give my life for yours." 

i know we are ­ we are the lucky ones.
i know we are ­ we are the lucky ones.
i know we are ­ we are the lucky ones, dear.

the first time we made love, i ­ i wasn't sober. 
(and you told me you loved me over and over!) 
how could i ever love another, when i miss you every day ­

remember the time we made love in the roses? 
(and you took my picture in all sorts of poses!) 
how could i ever get over you, when i'd give my life for yours.

i know we are... we are the lucky ones.
i know we are... we are the lucky ones.
i know we are... we are the lucky ones.
i know we are ­ we are the lucky ones, dear.

Keep Myself Awake~
I hate to talk like this 
I hate to act as if there's something wrong 
But I can't say I have this dream at night almost every night 
I've been dreaming it forever 
It's easy to remember, it's always cold always day always here 
Always say I'm alright I'll be okay 
If I can keep myself awake (keep myself awake...) 
I get up early and look around me 
And can't help but wonder what you mean 
But I'm sleeping I'm so deep in 
So much more real to me closer than reality 
It's always cold always day always here 
Always say I'm alright I'll be okay 
If I can keep myself awake (keep myself awake...) 
I get up early I look around me 
I'm buying coffee by the pound 
But I'm sleeping so deep in it 
I can't keep myself awake (keep myself awake...)

Virgin State Of Mind~
There's a chair in my head on which I used to sit
Took a pencil and I wrote the following on it

Now there's a key where my wonderful mouth used to be
Dig it up, throw it at me
Dig it up, throw it at me

Where can I run to, where can I hide
Who will I turn to now I'm in a virgin state of mind

Got a knife to disengage the voids that I can't bear
To cut out words I've got written on my chair

Like do you think I'm sexy
Do you think I really care

Can I burn the mazes I grow
Can I, I don't think so

Can I burn the mazes I grow
Can I, I don't think so

Where can I run to, where can I hide
Who will I turn to now I'm in a virgin state of mind
Virgin state of mind
Virgin state of mind
Virgin state of mind

Already Met You~
The first date's the worst date 
It's hard to know just what to do 
And I take you to dinner 
You don't eat, you just play with your food 
And there's something familiar 
About every word you say 
It's hard to believe it's happening again 

I already met you 
And I already met you 
You're like my last girlfriend 
Yes, and the girlfriend I had before her 

I take you to my apartment 
And then it's just south of Beirut 
And you tell me you're bored 
And you don't like the color of my shoes 
And the picture gets clearer with every word you say 
It's hard to believe it's happening again 

I already met you 
And I already met you 
You're like my last girlfriend 
Yes, and the girlfriend I had before her 

Don't mean to upset you 
I already met you 
You're like my last girlfriend 
Yes, and the girlfriend I had before her 

Two points two kids and a house on the hill 
A dog named BOO and sweet Uncle Phil...Fella? 

My head says you're different 
You're the one with whom I should grow old 
Yeah, that's not toconvicing 
When you're yelling at your dad on my phone 
So I stare out the window 
And I find me a simle 'Cause I still believe it gets better than this 

I already met you 
And I already met you 
You're like my last girlfriend 
Yes, and the girlfriend I had before her 

Don't mean to upset you 
I already met you 
You're like my last girlfriend 
Yes, and the girlfriend I had before her 
You're like my last girlfriend 
Yes, and the girlfriend I had before her 
And the girlfriend I had before her 
And the girlfriend I had before her 
And the girlfriend I had before that.

Face to Face~
The Devil You Know~
It's all right
Everything is fine
You live the perfect life
Never one immoral thought inside your mind

What they say
Does it make you feel ashamed?
Isn't everyone the same?
Does it matter that it wasn't your idea
God is a man
You know for certain
The knowledge in and of itself
Is more than we deserve

So you've tried
And you've made up your mind
Something's still not right
The devil you don't know is still outside

Nothing But You~
I think i'll go for a walk 
Maybe out in the rain 
Maybe there'll be tears rolling down my face 
And i'd feel the pain 
Maybe think about something 
Maybe think about you 

Yeah you can't hurt me now 
You know you can't hurt me now 
You can't hold me down 

And i've got plenty of time 
Time to figure it out 
Time to think about you and me 
Whatever that was all about 
Got nothing to prove 
Got nothing to say 
No i'm guessing I never thought you 
were good for me anyway 
Got nothing to lose 
Nothing but you 

I think i'll go for a ride 
Til my memory fades 
Roll down the windows and glide 
Down 75 to the Everglades 
Maybe light up a joint 
And take a walk on the moon 

Yeah you can't reach me now 
You know you can't touch me now 
You can't hold me down 

And i've got plenty of time 
Time to figure it out 
Time to think about you and me 
Whatever that was all about 
Got nothing to prove 
Got nothing to say 
No i'm guessing I never thought you 
were good for me anyway 
Got nothing to lose 
Nothing but you 
Nothing but you 

Why do you have to be so unkind? 
Why do I have to be so inclined 
To loose my mind? 

Well i've got plenty of time 
Time to figure it out 
Time to think about you and me 
Whatever that was all about 
Got nothing to prove 
Got nothing to say 
No i'm guessing I never thought you 
were good for me anyway 
Got nothing to lose 
Nothing but you 
Oooo, nothing but you 
Yeah, n-n-nothing

Alison Krauss and Union Station~
It Doesn't Matter~
It doesn't matter what I want 
It doesn't matter what I need 
It doesn't matter if I cry 
Don't matter if I bleed 
You've been on a road 
Don't know where it goes or where it leads 

It doesn't matter what I want 
It doesn't matter what I need 
If you've made up your mind to go 
I won't beg you to stay 
You've been in a cage 
Throw you to the wind you fly away 

It doesn't matter what I want 
It doesn't matter what I need 
It doesn't matter if I cry 
Don't matter if I bleed 
Feel the sting of tears 
Falling on this face you've loved for years

Wild Horses~
Childhood living is easy to do 
The things you wanted I bought them for you 
Graceless lady, you know who I am, 
You know I can't let you slide through my hands 

Wild Horses, 
Couldn't drag me away, 
Wild, wild horses, 
Couldn't drag me away... 

I watched you suffer a dull, aching pain 
Now you decided to show me the same 
No sweeping exits or offstage lines, 
Can make me feel bitter or treat you unkind 

Wild Horses, 
Couldn't drag me away,Wild, wild horses, 
Couldn't drag me away... 

I know I dreamed you a sin and a lie, 
I have my freedom but I don't have much time 
Faith has been broken tears must be cried, 
Let's do some living after we die 

Wild Horses, 
Couldn't drag me away, 
Wild, wild horses, 
We'll ride them someday 

Wild Horses, 
Couldn't drag me away, 
Wild, wild horses, 
We'll ride them someday

Pain~
Feeling I've been lost for years 
You can never understand me 
Unless you've seen those tears 
But you never get to sleep when I'm away 
I don't mind the deeper that you lay 
Out of time 
Pain 
I can't sleep 
Pain 
I can't sleep 
Running, running from those days 
There's another one inside me 
Guess I've gone insane 
But you always run away 
When I come around 
I don't mind the day 
I'll track you down 
Run you down 
Pain 
I can't sleep 
Pain 
I can't sleep 
Don't stop 
Don't talk 
Do not (fuck) with me 
Don't stop 
Don't talk 
Do not (fuck) with me 
Loaded, loaded up this gun 
There's a killer in me 
Hoping, hope that you're the one 
But you always run away 
When I come around 
I don't mind the day 
I'll track you down 
And terrify 
Pain 
I can't sleep 
Pain 
I can't sleep 
Pain 
I can't sleep

Splendid~
Charge~
The way you love 
Have you got a name for it 
Cause I don't understand it 
The language is an annoying necessity 
And I depend on all the regular things 
Got a list tattooed on my memory 
Of how our tryst should unfold 

I'm falling from the opposite 
What good is it 
Fight the map with no key attached 
My heart's enlarged and I charge 

What do you say 
To a dream that won't go away 
Cause I don't know if I can stand it 
Forever isn't something you want to be 
And I rely on familiar things 
Seven days all have special meanings 
But you just call it a week 

I'm falling from the opposite 
What good is it 
Fight the map with no key attached 
My heart's enlarged and I charge 

I'm falling from the opposite 
What good is it 
Fight the map with no key attached 
My heart's enlarged and I charge 

The night is young 
And the moon is a mother to both of us 
We both understand this 
Marriage is an old and tired religion 
And I love all the traditional things 
Domestic bliss and all that shit 
Confusion is a definite direction 

I'm falling from the opposite 
What good is it 
Fight the map with no key attached 
My heart's enlarged and I charge 

I'm falling from the opposite 
What good is it 
Fight the map with no key attached 
My heart's enlarged and I charge 

I'm falling from the opposite 
What good is it 
Fight the map with no key attached 
My heart's enlarged and I charge

Transylvanian Concubine~
If you want to know how
To fly high, then go now
To the place where all the concubines...
Meet and converse with them
Marvel at their pale skin
Wonder how they chew on their pointy...
Teeth and hair are beauty
They know it's their duty
To be countess in their hearts and their...
Minds that have to whisper
See in them a sister
Look into their eyes and you'll become
Transylvanian Concubine.
You know what flows here like wine.
Stay here with us, it's just time.
Transylvanian Concubine.
Sorrow is their master
Cackling with laughter
Now he's having just one piece of...
Cakey is their make-up
Catholics try to shake up
All the things that form their lives, but
they're...
Dead, their sighs, their songs
They know what they do is wrong.
Stay here with us, it's just time.
Transylvanian Concubine.
Candelabra's lighted
Satan has been sighted
Never has there been an evening like...
This is what they wanted
Always to feel hunted
You can never be too rich or too...
Thin. The blood has run out.
Fangs ruin any cute pout
Morning has come now they've flown
What have you learned from what has been
shown?

Stop Thinking About It~
Stop thinking about it
Stop thinking about it
Stop thinking about it
Stop thinking about it
Dwelling is driving me crazy
Obsessing don't you know where that's at
Yeh, you don't know what you want but you want it

Stop thinking about it (4x)

This world is driving you crazy
Baby don't you know where that's at
Yeh, you don't know what you want but you want it

Oh oh oh oh oh you don't know what you want but you want it

Stop thinking about it (4x)

Ahh nothing lasts forever
And nothing stays the same
Feeling numb all over
And totally deranged
When you finally make your mind up
I'll be buried in my grave

O yeah o yeah o yeah
Allright

You don't know what you want
You don't know what you need
You don't know what you want but you want it

Bohemian Like You~
You've got a great car
Yeah, what's wrong with it today?
I used to have one too
Maybe you should come and have a look
I really like your hairdo
I'm glad you like mine too
I see we're looking pretty cool
So what do you do?
Oh, you're waiting tables too?
No I haven't heard your band
Because you guys are pretty new
But if you love vegan food
Come over to my work
I'll have them look you something that you'll really love
Cuz I like you
Yeah I like you
And I feel so Bohemian like you
Wait
Who's that guy, just hangin at your pad?
He's looking kinda sad
Oh, you broke up?
That's too bad
But I guess it's fair
If he always pays the rent
And he doesn't get all bent
About sleeping on the couch when I'm there
Cuz I like you
Yeah I like you
And I'm feeling so bohemian
I feel so bohemian like you
And I want you
Please
Just a casual thing
Cuz I like you I like you I like you
Whoo-hoo-ooo

Everybody Got Their Something~
My face to the sky
Dreaming about just how high
I could go and I'll know
When I finally get there

Taking of my glasses
Sun pokes through my lashes
And somehow I know
There's a time for every star to shine

Everybody got their something
Everybody got their something
Make you smile like an itty bitty child

People keeping score
Say better hurry up and get yours
Cause somebody else get your spot
Before you even dropped

Seek and you shall find
Everything in my own sweet time
I'll take my chances
With what I believe is only mine

Busy holding on
So the roof don't fly
Keep you from moving on
So get it right
Turn the tide over
Like a love song
Like a butterfly
Believe if you hand it over
You'll come out all right

Everybody got their something
Everybody got their something
Make you smile like an itty bitty child

Illuminate the silly things
Shed some light on all that's wrong
Everybody need it sometime
Sometimes the only thing you got
Is what makes you feel like
You're something else altogether
You have everything don't need
Another reason to be something
I've been on a ride
And caught up in the landslide
But I'm gonna spread my wings and fly...

Everybody got their something
Everybody got their something
Make you smile like an itty bitty child

There's a time for every star
There's a time for every star...

Key~
You think you can have both of them and I want you to know
That Im in, Im in
And this time Im staying to bur the trail that you left, you left
And if I was cold, well then you would stay inside me, warm me
Here Im safe so here I stay
Lift me out, lift the doubt
You asked me to say what I had done
I told you just like I told everyone
I still have some doubts that you are the reason
Still this is just so hard cause I know that Ill be left like always
Here Im safe so here I stay
Lift me out, lift the doubt

Ballad for Dead Friends~
How are you feeling 
Do you feel ok? 
Cos I don't

It keeps me reelin'
Will I ever be the same?
No I won't

Its a cold day in a cruel world
I really wished I could have saved you
Then who would save me from myself?
Right now, well, I could use a stiff drink
To kill the pain that's deep inside my bones
Have you been dreaming?
I don't dream at all
I have nightmares
Memories careenin'
Have you come to kill what's left
Of my smile
Theres no vacancy in paradise
I really wished I could have saved you
Then who would have saved me from myself
Right now, well, I could use a stiff drink
To kill the pain thats deep inside my bones
I really wished I could have saved you
Then who would ahve saved me from myself

I'll never forget you
I'll never forget you
I'll never forget you
I'll never forget you

I really wished I could have saved you
I really wished I could have saved you
I really wished I could have saved you
I really wished I could have saved you

Blue~
Night falls
I fall
And where were you?
And where were you?

Warm skin
Wolf grin
And where were you?

I fell into the moon
And it covered you in blue
I fell into the moon
Can I make it right?
Can I spend the night?

High tide
Inside
The air is dew
And where were you?

While I
I died
And where were you?

I crawled out of the world
And you said I shouldn't stay
I crawled out of the world
Can I make it right?
Can I spend the night
Alone?

Pavlov's Bell~
Oh Mario -- sit here by the window
Stay here 'til we reach Idaho
And when we go
Hold my hand on take-off
Tell me what I already know
That we can't talk about it
No, we can't talk about it

Because nobody knows
That's how I nearly fell
Trading clothes
And ringing Pavlov's bell
History shows
There's not a chance in hell -- but --

Oh Mario -- We're only to Ohio
It's kinda getting harder to breathe
I won't let it show --
I'm all about denial --
But can't denial let me believe?
That we could talk about it
But we can't talk about it

Because nobody knows
That's how I nearly fell
Trading clothes
And ringing Pavlov's bell
History shows -- but rarely shows it well
Well, well, well --

Oh Mario -- why if this is nothing
I'm finding it so hard to dismiss
If you're what I need,
Then only you can save me
So come on baby -- give me the fix
And let's just talk about it
I've got to talk about it

Because nobody knows
That's how I nearly fell
Trading clothes
And ringing Pavlov's bell
History shows --
Like it was show and tell

So tell me Mario

There's No Other Way~
You're taking the fun
Out of everything
Making me run
When I don't want to think
You're taking the fun
Out of everything
I don't want to think at all

There's no other way
There's no other way
All that you can do
Is watch them play

You're taking the fun
Out of everything
You're making it clear
When I don't want to think
You're taking me up
When I don't want to go up anymore
I'm just watching it all

There's no other way
There's no other way
All that you can do
Is watch them play

Sarah McLachlan~
Prayer of Saint Francis~
Lord make me an instrument of your peace 
Where there is hatred let me sow love. 
Where there is injury pardon. 
Where there is doubt faith. 
Where there is despair hope. 
Where there is darkness light. 
And where there is sadness joy. 
O divine master grant that I may 
not so much seek to be consoled as to console; 
to be understood as to understand; 
To be loved as to love 
For it is in giving that we receive- 
it is in pardoning that we are pardoned. 
And it's in dying that we are born to eternal life. 
Amen.
