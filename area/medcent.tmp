A severe-looking `cnurse`x seated at the admittance desk.
~
A blunt-cut bob frames a disagreeable-looking face, her pale skin and
hooked nose contributing to this illusion.  Her uniform is crisp and white,
with a bright red cross over the left breast pocket.  Sensible white nurse's
shoes are visible beneath the wooden desk she sits at, the admittance forms
arranged into a neat stack in front of her, along with a cup full of black
ballpoint pens and an industrial-sized bottle of hand-sanitizer.  
 
You can `cadmit`x yourself here to receive medical care.

labeled as a First Response Early Result Home Pregnancy Test.  "Results as
early as five days before your missed period!"  A capped plastic stick
inside gives directions on holding it in the urine stream for five seconds
with results in two minutes.  A few legal disclaimers on the fallibility of
the test itself are inconspicuously written in fine print.

Rows of plastic chairs are bolted to the floor in this brightly-lit
waiting room, tables covered in magazines and newspapers set at regular
intervals among the seats.  Informative charts and graphs cover the walls,
and pamphlet holders marked 'Take One' hold information on such topics as
insurance and dietary health.  

A desk near the double-doors to the east offer patients the opportunity to
sign in for admittance, and to the north a small shop displays balloons and
cards on rotating stands.

strategically placed circular drains.  Two flat eggshell walls are dominated
by individual stainless steel drawers, programmed to maintain a constant
temperature and each numbered for organization.  The near nauseating smell
of bleach and disinfectants weighs heavily upon the area.

`RDowntown `WMedical `R- `WA Dimly-Lit Autopsy Room`w~
The dingy white color of the walls does nothing to help the cramped space
of this hospital autopsy room.  Dim flourescent lighting provides a fickle
illumination, making the bleached small white tiles underfoot seem all the
more drab.  Several long, stainless steel operating tables have been evenly
laid out, with frosted glass cabinets holding instruments similar to what is
found in surgical suites.  Large metal sinks are bolted along one side, with
rolling metal trays and calibrated scales to assist with procedures.

W The dingy white color of the walls does nothing to help the cramped space
of this hospital autopsy room.  Jagged fissures seem to have altered the
perimeter, permitting a decaying mist to cling to the air.  Dim flourescent
lighting flickers in yellowed rectangles upon the ceiling.  Grimy lines of
grout separate the small white tiles underfoot, interspersed with circular
drains which appear clogged with an indeterminate reddish ooze.  Several
long, stainless steel operating tables are laid out, with cabinets holding
instruments similar to surgical suites.  Large metal sinks are bolted along
one side, with unsterilized trays and scales to assist with procedures.

Off to the southern side of the medical center's entrance lies this
relatively small counter.  Ceiling high glass cuts off further access to the
many medicine filled shelves beyond, but a small opening near the counter's
surface allows medication to be dealt out to consumers.
