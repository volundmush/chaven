The White Oak Institute is an Academic Medical centre located in Haven MA. The campus combines an undergraduate college and local hospital with a particularly developed mental health wing.

As well as regular classes the college also offers lessons that specialize in the supernatural, helping newly developed supernatural harness and control their abilities in a safe and controlled environment. The conjoined mental health clinic allows them to more effectively manage the often mentally unstable students while also providing services to the wider Haven community.

The clinic is also frequently used by the societies which operate out of Haven to store prisoners or other inconvenient individuals where they wont be able to interfere with their affairs.

The college has several athletic programs with the teams being known as the White Oak Wildcats. While football tends to draw the most attention the school tends to perform better at lacrosse and competitive cheer.

The college is a faith-based but non-denominational institution with dedicated chaplains and regular religious events and activities. The institute is quite conservative and brags consistently about the effectiveness of its abstinence-only sex education programs. There is even a traditional school uniform although it is only compulsory for one or two formal events.

The Faculty of White Oak are almost always recruited from out of state without much in the way of local connections.

While rarely spoken outright it is widely understood that the White Oak institute aims to prevent newly developing supernaturals and others involved in the supernatural world from falling to corruption through instilling discipline and faith in the student body.

Text Eidolon is the term for a variety of different spiritual entities which draw their power from belief, sacrifice, and the arcane and work in and through the world.

`cOrigins`W:`x
Eidolons have multiple possible origins, some are created by Fae, Gods or even powerful magical users to serve them or their interests. Sometimes Eidolons are created by accident when a large magical working is undertaken. Some are born from local belief and dreams and some used to be people who have transformed themselves into an Eidolon, usually as part of a quest to eventually ascend into godhood or a similar level of power.

`cPowers`W:`x
Eidolons have limited direct power but have significant ability to work through other agents. They can generally control animals, weather and machinery but their main strength is working through human agents. Eidolons have significant powers to influence and manipulate people as well as the ability to grant them great powers and boons to enhance them. They can also often possess people, even frequently against their will and this is their only real way of experiencing the physical world. It is common for Eidolons to possess people and then encourage or manipulate them into doing exciting or interesting things for the Eidolon to experience. This often includes extremely dangerous activities and even often fatal ones so the Eidilon can enjoy the sensation of death before moving on.
Eidolons can create and/or control more minor spirits and ghosts and often use them as their agents to spread their goals and progress their interests.

Eidolons do not have their own source of power, they need to draw on supernatural power from other sources. Sacrifices, either of life or blood help them gain power, so does power channeled through belief, worship and other sacrifice but the most reliable source of power is arcane objects. The valuable resources that supernatural societies hold in their vaults often serve as some of the best sources of power for Eidolons.

`cAscension`W:`x
If an Eidolon gains enough power and has a a catalyst they can use that power to transform themselves into something else. This usually requires rare and very powerful items as well and/or complex rituals with exacting requirements. There is no specific limitation on what an Eidolon can transform themselves into given enough power but the two most typical forms of ascension are either to become physical, becoming an entity such as a god or true-fae or demon lord. Or to entirely transcend the mortal plane and become a kind of latent supernatural force in the world. Generally not even being really conscious anymore but rather existing in a sort of eternal dream state.

`cDestruction`W:`x
The exact same things that empower Eidolons can be used to drain power from them with similar sorts of sacrifices, powerful objects and rituals. A powerful enough catalyst can even be used to destroy an Eidolon entirely by reducing its power below that which is required to sustain itself and causing the Eidolon to disperse away into nothingness.

`cTypes`W:`x
There are no specific rules on what an Eidolon can be, but there are several broad types into which they tend to fall.

`gFae`W:`x
Common origins for Fae Eidolons is that they begin as some sort of spirit of mischief that achieves a higher level of sentience and power or that they are created by a true Fae to serve their interests or goals and grow from there.

Fae Eidolons almost always seek to ascend into becoming true Fae and are frequently categorized by a focus on enjoyment and experience, they spend a lot of time possessing their followers and having them engage in more and more extreme hedonistic and thrill seeking behaviour.

`CDivine`W:`x
Divine Eidolons are usually created by a God to be some sort of servant or further their interests. They usually are aspected in a way very similar to the God that created them, such that Eidolons created by a war god are often heavily focused on war and warlike activities. Some gods support their Eidolons ascending and even want them to become a lower ranked god in their divine court but often the Eidolon resents their divine master and are trying to ascend behind their back and/or as a way to break away from their court and control. These can often be particularly complex entities since they both resent a particular god while still being made in their image.

Divine Eidolons almost always seek to ascend into becoming a god themselves and their focuses are as varied as the gods who created them.

`rDemonic`W:`x
Demonic Eidolons are almost always created by demons as a way to influence Earth in a way they generally cannot do while being locked in hell. Its also common for demonic Eidolons to be humans who have been transformed as part of some deal or pact, either done to them or something they have sought out themselves in a quest for power and immortality. Demonic Eidolons almost always have the same innate desire for suffering as other demons do.

Demonic Eidolons ascension goals are highly varied, its common for them to seek ascension into a demon lord but also common for them to seek ascension into a malicious force to more effectively promote suffering throughout the world.

The behaviour of demonic Eidolons is usually typified by the demonic interest in suffering, they tend to use their followers to try and create and promote suffering and rarely can help themselves from also forcing suffering upon their followers. This is often their greatest weakness as they try and walk the line between maximizing the suffering and not driving people away.

`DGhost`W:`x
Ghostly Eidolons are ghosts who have been able to obtain enough followers or power after their death to ascend into something more powerful. They are as varied as the humans who died to become them but often are fixated on the circumstances of their death and any injustices they suffered or other grudges they had while alive.

Their ascension goals are varied but its common for them to seek to ascend into a non-sentient force as a way of seeking peace after death.

They often try to use their followers to carry on any missions or grudges they had in life, wanting them to attack the descendants of their enemies or embody the lifestyle or culture they used to have.

`gCthulian`W:`x
Cthulian Eidolons come from the void and almost nothing is known about their origin. It is suspected that at least some of them used to be human however. Cthulian Eidolons often ascend into either powerful monstrous forms or ethereal entities but either way they always seem to disappear from the world shortly afterwards, presumably returning to the void for unknown reasons.

Cthulian Eidolons goals are quite alien and difficult for people to understand, they are often unspeakably cruel but do not seem to enjoy it in the same way as demons and often have their followers do things which make no sense at all to the members of the cult. Hunger is the only common theme among Cthulian Eidolons and they often will possess a human while they are feasting or become fixating on people consuming unusual things such as drinking blood or engaging in cannibalism.

`yPrimal`W:`x
Primal Eidolons are usually formed from the worship of Nature or when a particularly remarkable and unusual animal dies but some are also human shamans or nature worshippers who are using it as a way to ascend.

Primal Eidolons almost always ascend into non-corporeal spirits of natural force although rarely some will ascend into some sort of animalistic god.

Their interests vary depending on the origin of the spirit, those which are evolved natural spirits are often deeply focused on preserving and growing the natural world, fighting against industrialization and civilization. Those who come from animal origins have goals which are heavily influenced by the type of animal they are, predators encourage their followers to engage in more predation and may enjoy possessing people while hunting. Pack animals have cults which are more communal while other animals might be more contemplative or playful.

Text `WSyntax:`x Make Blessing

Blessings are things Eidolons can create in order to reward their followers. Each blessing has
a boon and a curse and both are applied to the target at the same time. All blessings additionally
cost some resources unless the boon is 'Noworries' or 'Bliss'.
Blessings cost more resources if the Eidolon has given out those boons or curses more frequently. The
cost will be shown prior to approval.

Blessings can be granted to offline characters, but not to those who are currently restrained.
Blessings generally last for 24 hours.

`WBoons:`x

on that date. You can avoid this fate either by rerolling or otherwise finishing your character's story
before then. Alternatively your character can go into hiding to change their fate and avoid their doom.
To do this you will have to not log that character into the game for one month from the date of their
doom. You can stasis the character, reroll them, make a guest, play an alt or just take a break from the
game. Regardless of what you choose if and when you return to the game you will have successfully have
avoided that doom, but that doesn't mean a new one one be waiting for you.

Text Haven's clothing system is versatile, but not necessarily immediately intuitive; it will always follow a certain set of rules, but to have your attire look the way you want it to, you need a firm grasp of how these rules interact with one another in order to present yourself as desired. 

The first thing to understand is that there are four item 'sections'. The first section has two 'slots', and is limited to two items; it represents what's held in your hands. This is where any item that is NOT clothing, armour, jewelry, or (most) containers will go. The second section is where the vast majority of your worn items will go: clothing, armour, and worn containers like backpacks, over the shoulder purses, cargo pants, and so on. The third section is jewelry, and the last section is sort of more of a half-section in that you do not wear anything there, but it is where items sized large that you are carrying will be displayed. In its base form with no customised wear strings (more on this in a minute), it looks like this:

(D) a bone and crystal charm on a pendant
(S) a narrow silver band with a serpent
 
(C) a full-body black silk robe, carried
 
In this example, this gothy little witch Tamara is holding her iphone, wearing a lot of black silk, has on some silver jewelry, and is carrying a big robe in her arms because she must've just got out of her latest cult meeting. You're probably wondering what all those letters mean:
 
`g(`WA`g)`x means an item is `yarmour`x, and provides protection in combat.
`g(`WC`g)`x means an item is a `ycontainer`x and can hold other items. These can be worn.
`g(`WD`g)`x means an item is `ydescribed`x, which means you can, for example, `g'`Wlook tamara bodice`g'`x to see what's written about it.
`g(`WE`g)`x means an item is `yexpensive`x, which has a threshold that varies based on item type.
`g(`WK`g)`x means an item is a `ykey`x to the `Wgoblin market`x.
`g(`WS`g)`x means an item is marked with a `ysociety's symbol`x, marking the bearer as someone who is 'aware'. This can be looked at to see which symbol it is.
 
Items can, of course, have none of these flags, like Tamara's sash. But what if multiple things are true? In that case, one flag takes precedence over the others for display, though when actively looked at they will all be shown. In order of display priority (that is, from least important to most important) they are: expensive, container, described, armour, key, symbol.
 
Next you need to understand what determines what items show where when looking at someone. You might think this is related to the order of your body locations, but this is not actually the case; it is based entirely on the wear layer of your clothing. Layers can be any number between `W0`g-`W5`x, though you should really only use `W1`g-`W5`x; layer `W0`x is a catch-all layer. Clothing layers determine not just what items of clothing cover what (a layer `W1`x panty, for example, is covered by a layer `W2`x skirt), but also in what order items and clothing are *displayed* when looked at. Tamara here has a hood of layer `W5`x, her bodice /and/ sash are layer `W4`x, her skirt is layer `W3`x, and her heels are layer `W1`x. It's reasonable to wonder why her sash is not layer `W3`x and her skirt layer `W2`x, but you need to remember that there are also layers of clothing that are /not/ displayed: her panties are layer `W2`x, and were she in something other than a bodice, her bra would be layer `W3`x.
 
In the case of multiple items with the same layer, they are displayed in reverse order of how they're worn. Imagine stacking rings on a peg: if Tamara puts her sash on first and then her bodice, it displays as you see in the example above. Were she to wear her bodice first and then the sash, it'd be the opposite. Items will 'remember' where on this imaginary peg they are even if the other items surrounding them are removed, and new items applied to that layer will go to the lowest spot available to them. For example, if Tamara takes her sash off and then puts it -- or any other layer `W4`x item -- back on, it will be ordered below her bodice. In order to change display orders for the same layer, all items on that layer should be removed and re-worn in the desired order. Think of these 'sub-slots', for a given layer as being, for example, `W4`g.`W1`x, `W4`g.`W2`x, `W4`g.`W`3, `W4`g.`W4`x, and `W4`g.`W5`x `g(`xthe maximum number of items per layer being `W5`g)`x. Removing the items in `W4 and `W4`g.`W5`x aren't going to change the item in `W4`g.`W4`x -- it will remain `W4`g.`W4`x.
 
Additionally, items can have 'wear strings', which are modifiers to how they appear when you're looked at. Tamara is not using any wear strings, which is fine; you don't need to. They can, though, add a lot of versatility to your appearance and add some added flavour and style to your appearance. Using her items as an example, she could:
 
`Wwear bodice 4 cinches her waist in tight`x
`Wwear hood 5 , shrouding her face in shadow`x
`yto have people then see`x
(E) a voluminous black silk hood, shrouding her face in shadow
(D) a snug, black silk bodice cinches her waist in tight
 
Note how the comma automatically pairs to the item itself like it ought to. Should Tamara decide she likes this new look for her bodice, it can be made permanent by using the `Wcustomize`x command at a tailor, either in-line as `Wcustomize bodice wear cinches her waist in tight`x, or via the full customize interface. Items can also be prepended with a wear string in parentheses:
 
`Wwear hood 5 (head)`x
`Wwear bodice 4 (cinched in)`x 
`yresults in`x
(head)       (E) a voluminous black silk hood
(cinched in) (D) a snug, black silk bodice
 
Note that in this example there's some extra padding after the hood's wear string; all prefixed wear strings function this way.
 
If this seems like a lot, don't worry! It is, but that's it; nothing more needs to be understood in order to control your appearance. There are, though, a few other things worth noting about worn items:
 
`cClothing and armour cover body descriptions, but jewelry does not.`x
 
`cWorn items can help regulate your body temperature`g:`x
 Items whose short descriptions contain the words `Wfur`g, `Wheated`g, `Winsulated`g, `Wpadded`g, `Wquilted`g, `Wthermal`g,`x or `Wwool`x make you warmer, and help suppress messages about shivering in cold.
 Items whose short descriptions contain the words `Wmerino`x or `Wvented`x make you cooler, and help suppress messages about sweating in the heat.
 
`cWorn items can help provide defensive camouflage in combat`g:`x
 Items whose short and long descriptions contain the words `Wblack`g, `Wdark`g, `Wgray`g,`x or `Wgrey`x provide camouflage in caves.
 Items whose short and long descriptions contain the words `Wgray`g, `Wgrey`g,`x or `Wwhite`x provide camouflage in mountains.
 Items whose short and long descriptions contain the word `Wwhite`x provide camouflage in tundra.
 Items whose short and long descriptions contain the words `Wcamouflage`x or `Wgreen`x provide camouflage in forest.
 Items whose short and long descriptions contain the words `Wyellow`x or `Wsandy`x provide camouflage in desert.
 `yFor camouflage to function, it requires three items of visible clothing with the relevant keywords.`x

Keyword Follower Combat Behavior~

Level 0

Text Followers - that is, `Wminions`x, hired muscle `Wcontacts`x, and additional manpower granted via `Wsociety commands`x, occasionally follow some of the same rules and additionally each have their own quirks. Understanding these behaviours is key to maintaining a lack of frustration with followers when in a combat scenario.
 
`c[`WManpower`g/`WSoldiers`c]`g:`x
  `g-`x Soldiers will prioritise attacking other soldier NPCs before moving on to PCs, even if given orders not to do so.
  `g-`x Soldiers will then prioritise minions and muscle over PCs.
  `g-`x Soldiers ignore commands given when there are no hostile NPCs on the battlefield or in their sight line.
  `g-`x The amount of assigned manpower on an operation has bearing on the amount of hostile NPCs that spawn; more manpower results in more spawns.
 
`c[`WMinions`g/`WMuscle`c]`g:`x
  `g-`x Minions and muscle contacts, unlike soldiers, do not automatically assume anything in the field of combat is `Rhostile`x.
  `g-`x Someone becomes `Rhostile`x when the minion or muscle is told to attack it, or when it attacks the minion or muscle.
  `g-`x They may ignore commands if they are told to target something that they cannot see; remember their sightlines may not match yours.
  `g-`x Their behaviour is dictated by their disciplines`g:`x
    `c-`x If their melee discipline is the same as or slightly higher than ranged, they will prefer to charge and fire, or fight back in melee if engaged.
    `c-`x If ranged is higher than melee, they will prefer to disengage and attempt to gain distance to fire, even if attacked when in cover.
  `g-`x When told to engage `Watwill`x, they will only focus on `Rhostile`x targets, as defined above.
  `g-`x When told to engage `Watwill`x, they will try and assist their commanding PC with the targets the PC focuses on.
  `g-`x They will follow their last instructions if their commanding PC dies.
    `c-`x If they were told to `Wfollow`x, they become stationary, attacking hostile targets in range.
    `c-`x If they were told to `Wattack`x, they will pursue their target until either they die, or it dies, whereupon they revert to the above.
    `c-`x If they were told to act `Watwill`x, they will actively move to engage `Rhostile`x targets in their range; otherwise, they are stationary.
  `g-`x Be prepared to micromanage if you want ideal behaviour out of your minions or muscle contacts; think of `Wfollow`x as a leash.

Text The Temple has three subfactions: the Temple Strike Force, who are the Temple's military and the most elite military group in the world; the Temple Demolishers, an even more destructive group consisting of chipped supernaturals and experimental weapons; and Temple Intelligence, who handle technological development and espionage.
 
`c[`WTemple Strike Force`c]`g:`x
  The most elite military group in the world, armed with weaponry most countries have never even heard of and occasionally even featuring a rare supernatural member, the Temple's strike team is feared by supernaturals the world over for their ruthless efficiency.
   `cCommon Allies`g :`x Other Temple groups, the Keepers, FBI
   `cCommon Enemies`g:`x Order/Hand, the Vampire Court of New York, the Redwood Pack, the Coven, the Chosen, the Syndicate
   `yPrefers`g       :`x Higher ranked Temple members
   `yTypical Tasks`g :`x The elimination or capture of the Temple's enemies, sabotage, assassination.

 
`c[`WTemple Demolishers`c]`g:`x
  If the strike team is the Temple's surgical sledgehammer, the Demolishers are their wrecking ball. An almost experimental group containing most of the Temple's supernaturals as well as those wielding experimental weaponry, the Demolishers are deployed in situations where bystander casualties or stealth are not a concern; wherever they go they'll leave only rubble behind.
   `cCommon Allies`g :`x Other Temple groups, the Keepers
   `cCommon Enemies`g:`x Order/Hand, the Vampire Court of New York, the Redwood Pack, the Coven, the Chosen, the Syndicate
   `yPrefers`g       :`x Higher ranked Temple members
   `yTypical Tasks`g :`x Blowing shit up, killing the Temple's enemies via blowing shit up

 
`c[`WTemple Intelligence`c]`g:`x
  The eyes, ears, and brain of the Temple. Consisting largely of ex-intelligence agents and military intelligence officers, Temple intelligence agents are the reason the Temple knows so much and always has the latest in weaponry and anti-supernatural technology.
   `cCommon Allies`g :`x Other Temple groups, the Keepers, CIA
   `cCommon Enemies`g:`x Order/Hand, the Vampire Court of New York, the Redwood Pack, the Coven, the Chosen, the Syndicate
   `yPrefers`g       :`x Higher ranked Temple members

Text The Hand has three subfactions: the Peacekeeping Hand, who form the bulk of the Hand's brutal, largely-supernatural military strength; the Whispering Hand, who are the Hand's covert operatives; and the Whispering Hand, who deal with politicians and the public in general.
 
`c[`WPeacekeeping Hand`c]`g:`x
  The Peacekeepers are the Hand's soldiers, guards and police, called upon whenever martial might is required. They are structured similarly to a Roman legion and are the division in which humans are the least likely to be found. The Hand doesn't rely on martial force as much as the other factions, but when they do their policy is to ensure their opponent never wants to fight them again - as such the Peacekeepers usually display extreme brutality when deployed in battle.
   `cCommon Allies`g :`x Other Hand groups, the Vampire Court of New York
   `cCommon Enemies`g:`x Order/Temple/Keepers, occasionally other Hand groups
   `yPrefers`g       :`x Higher ranked Hand members, supernaturals
   `yTypical Tasks`g :`x Protecting important members of the Hand, protecting important locations or objects of the Hand, investigating supernatural crime, destroying or hurting the Hand's enemies

 
`c[`WShadow Hand`c]`g:`x
  The Shadows are the Hand's covert operatives; they handle assassinations, espionage, spying, and researching as well as R&D for technological and magical creations. Their exact numbers aren't well known, and they pride themselves on being able to reach anyone anywhere and knowing every secret that's worth knowing. An extremely technologically-advanced group, the Shadows are believed to have the world's most powerful supercomputer in one of their hidden facilities.
   `cCommon Allies`g :`x Other Hand groups, criminal subfactions, CIA
   `cCommon Enemies`g:`x FBI, Order/Temple/Keepers
   `yPrefers`g       :`x Higher ranked Hand members
   `yTypical Tasks`g :`x Spying on a target, acquiring intelligence, planting evidence, assassination, theft, research, weapons development

 
`c[`WWhispering Hand`c]`g:`x
  The Whisperers are the Hand's public face; they are its diplomats, PR agents, advertising executives, and politicians. They are dedicated to influencing the world at large to serve the agenda of the Hand, as well as handling relations with other groups. Those groups might be supernatural ones, or natural ones relating to the Hand through one of their many corporate fronts, the largest and most well-known of which is Coretech Industries.
   `cCommon Allies`g :`x Other Hand groups, FBI, Rushell Industries, Tyrell Corp
   `cCommon Enemies`g:`x Order/Temple/Keepers, the Aquarian Guard, the New World Movement
   `yPrefers`g       :`x Higher ranked Hand members
   `yTypical Tasks`g :`x Influencing elections, influencing politicians, influencing business, hosting parties, charity work, acquiring business, making a profit, diplomacy

Text `WThe Saltes`x: If any family can lay claim to being called the blue-collar family of Haven, it would be the Saltes. It was a Salte captain who's ship brought James Arkwright to Haven. It was a Salte's hands and ingenuity that led to the Lighthouse being built. To this day the Saltes provide Haven with its fish supply, among other things. (Please assume Wilbur keeps in regular contact with his family members)

`DTheme`x: The Saltes have a connection to the ocean that none of the other families can understand, but that they all respect. With the exception of the Inigos, who the Saltes used to serve in the 1800s, they have a strong relationship with the rest of the families, especially the Reeves (who they share similar values with) and the Wilsons (who they work extensively with).

Text There are three main focus paths: the arcane tree (minions, rituals, mancing); the combat tree (melee and ranged combat); and the professional tree (wealth, contacts, and social/job skills). Each focus tree has its own set of foci within it. Every point spent in one of these trees, regardless of whether or not it's on the same focus, unlocks greater potential for development in terms of stats and occasionally powers. When points are spent on the same focus, you develop additional abilities related to that focus line. The following are the unlocked abilities for the arcane tree:

Text There are three main focus paths: the arcane tree (minions, rituals, mancing); the combat tree (melee and ranged combat); and the professional tree (wealth, contacts, and social/job skills). Each focus tree has its own set of foci within it. Every point spent in one of these trees, regardless of whether or not it's on the same focus, unlocks greater potential for development in terms of stats and occasionally powers. When points are spent on the same focus, you develop additional abilities related to that focus line. The following are the unlocked abilities for the combat tree:

Cost is also affected by society positions if the character involved is in a society with spiritual or material inclinations; these are displayed in the helpfile for society positions but will be replicated here.

Vehicle cost depends on quality level and vehicle class, though the individual type of vehicle has no bearing: a tough vehicle and a luxury vehicle cost the same. Bear in mind that vehicles with two types (luxury sports cars, tough vans, and so on) cost twice as much for each quality level.

Keyword Conflicting Loyalties~

Text Conflicting loyalties is part of the world of Haven by design. There's little story to be had from a group of characters who are all on the same page and never disagree, but if those disagreements are caused by someone wanting to play wildly off-lore or just wanting to snowflake to the maximum this isn't fun for anyone else. Disagreements among allies due to legitimate philosophical differences or conflicting loyalties however provide a rich source of story which isn't about putting one player over another or having a winner or loser.

These conflicting loyalties can come from many places, your character's friendships, relationships, or family might conflict with their organization or they might be part of two organizations which often don't see eye to eye or even are overt enemies.

There will never be a one-size fits all solution to these conflicts as every one is likely to be unique. It could be a generally virtuous individual joining a corrupt but pro-environment society because of their staunch environmentalism and willingness to overlook the bad parts of that group because of it, it could be an individual sentenced in an Order trial to serve the Order for a year even though they'd rather not, or someone blackmailed into working for a corrupt group.

Every situation is going to be different as to why the character has a conflicting loyalty and what it means for how trustworthy or suspicious they are likely to be considered or treated.

Characters with conflicting loyalties are obligated to find ways to RP them in line with good RP practices. It would be nothing but irritation for a corrupt individual to join the Order out of a temporary oath only to do nothing useful for the Order and complain constantly on comms about hating them for example. Similarly those interacting with characters with conflicting loyalties are obligated to find ways to RP with them in line with good RP practices. It would be very appropriate to treat an individual only working for your organization because of an oath or blackmail or a particular shared goal with a great deal more suspicion for instance, it would be overtly terrible to ban them from society activities or lock them out of RP or try and force them to give up the source of the conflict however.

Text Characters generate intel as they engage in activities such as contributing resources to a society, setting up operations, going on adventures, roleplaying in dreamworlds or non-earth worlds or with higher powers. This represents your character learning valuable information about other worlds, society machinations and so on.

How much intel is generated is affected by a few factors, most notably the character's secrecy.

At 5k intel society characters get an extra $50 each week in their pay cheque, at 10k their contributes to their society are worth 20% more and give a buff to all contributes to that society for the next week. At 8k intel characters are considered reckless and thus easier to capture.

How much intel a character has can be seen by investigating them as long as they have at least 1000.

Characters when being victimized by a society character may choose the option to 'Give Intel' as a victimized response, this will transform all their intel into resources for the character victimizing them and can also provide benefits for the victimizer's society/character secrecy. Victimized characters who do not give intel will have the value of their intel reduced, but not by as much, and it wll not turn into resources for their victimizer.
 
Characters can give their intel to another with give intel (person)

Text The Founding Families have no special powers or abilities, the benefit of playing a Founding Family member is that you get to say you're a member of one of the Founding Families. If you outright begin to sabotage your Founding Family concept, staff reserves the right to kill your Founding Family member. You cannot play a Founding Family member and have story off. 
 
Rather than clog up the petition list with these applications, please send `rDaed`x a note. 

A Founding Family application should include the following:
`W*`x A five paragraph history, well written with clear information
`W*`x A goal for your Founding Family member
`W*`x If other Founding Family characters are active on grid, a blurb discussing your relationship with them (with their approval)
`W*`x Each Founding Family helpfile includes their theme, family positions, and preferred archetypes. Your app is more likely to be accepted if you have a theme.
 
`WThe following is information about the Founding Family leaders for history consideration.`x
 
`DJames Arkwright`x is 300+ years old. No Arwright characters can be older than 300. Non-negotiable.
 
`RAugustus Inigo`x is 70+ years old. Only demonborn ancestors can be older. None can be the firstborn son of any generation. All of Augustus' children are with the same woman, Barbara Inigo, who he is still married to. She's a fragile woman who most people pity due to rumors of domestic abuse.
 
`cPatricia Wilson`x is 70+ years old. Only supernatural members of the family can be older, and all must recognize Patricia's leadership of the family's holdings. All of Patricia's children are with one man. Patricia's husband was an angelborn from the bloodline of angelborn that are dedicated to the Wilsons' divine bloodline.
 
`WWilbur Salte`x is 70+ years old. Only supernatural members of the family can be older, and Wilbur's a little too set in his ways to accept leadership from any supernatural members of the family who happen to be older. All of Wilbur's children are with one woman. Rumors say she was a mermaid from the Aquarian Guard he fell in love with. She went missing after their last child, and the old man is always out on the ocean, with people saying he's looking for her. 
 
`yMary Moore`x is 50+ years old. Only supernatural members of the family can be older, and all must recognize Mary as the primary caregiver of the Moore wolf pack. Her children don't all have the same father, and she's raised them all herself. Demigods can be possibly negotiated into the Moore bloodline if they have a connection to the moon.

`GFrank Reeves`x is 50+ years old. Only supernatural members of the family can be older, and Frank doesn't really recognize any of them as family members unless they're siblings, niblings or children of his. All of Frank's children were born from the same woman, an Inigo who was one of Augustus' daughters. She's dead now. 

`gPeter Swann`x is 30+ years old. Only supernatural members of the family can be older. Peter's time in the Raincoat Games has made him the most powerful of his family, and gives him a reckless confidence that most of his living ancestors see as insolence. Peter at this time has no children.

This command can be used by SRs or Higher Powers to send a dream message to players. Sensitive characters who have trusted the
SR/HP to at least basic will always receive the message while anyone who is either sensitive or

Text The most central aspect of Haven's lore is that power is corruption.  If you are Tier 3 or higher you're a bad person, period.  If your society is corrupt, they're the bad guys, period.  If a society is virtuous, they're the good guys, period.  

There are complexities and nuances here for sure that are more than welcome, and you are free to think a bad guy is sympathetic, attractive, intelligent, charming or that a good guy is reckless, stupid, naive, foolish or ugly.  

You are absolutely not free to do this kinda 'No but the good guys are -really- the bad guys because xyz' or 'We're -really- the good guys because yzx' or 'They're really worse than us becuse zxy' RP unless you are: Unaware of the supernatural, insane, or very stupid.  Of course due to alliances you might see working with the bad guys as being the lesser of two evils or a neccessary evil but it is still an evil.  

There is no flexibility on this basic principle, people wanting to play moral characters play with very significant disadvantages in order to pay for that right.  Trying to subvert that is no different to trying to twink around someone's stats because you don't want to lose.

Text Higher Powers are considered T6 and function as a hybrid between a
StoryRunner and a more regular character.

They come in one of three types, demon, fae or god and are consequently
bound to one of those three worlds(hell, other, godrealm) and are generally
unable to leave it.

Higher powers are restricted from giving items/money similarly to SRs, they
can also be trusted with the `gtrust`x command and can use most storyrunner
commands on those who have trusted them including: Swalk, home, remote privates,
Spy, Inflict/Cure, Probe, hurt/injure, world award, emit, and summon.
They cannot however kill or critically injure PCs.

Higher powers have a domain, they can use `gdomain expand`x in their world
to add rooms to their domain, starting off with 5 rooms they gain more as
people RP inside of their domain, this also gives bonus newbie exp/rpexp
to further enhance themselves.

Characters can add to the domain of higher powers by using develop buildshrine.
In Haven township this will add a single room, in the wilds or inner forest a
room and all surrounding rooms, in the outer forest, a room and all rooms in
a two room radius.

Characters can also dedicate calendar events to a particular higher power,
which will extend their domain into the room where the event is taking place
for the duration.

Being inside a higher power's domain grants trust level 1, and this increases
to 2 after 45 minutes and 3 after 90 minutes. This only happens if someone
enters the domain voluntarily. Higher powers can enter other worlds as long
as they stay within their domain via swalk. Higher powers can never enter
the domain of other higher powers.

If a higher power creates a dreamworld that will also be considered part
of their domain and they will be able to see any RP that happens in it
as long as it isn't flagged private.

Higher powers have similar combat protections to nightmare monsters and
are even stronger in their own domain, they can be defeated but cannot be
killed by any means and will break out of any bindings almost immediately.
Higher powers cannot join societies or otherwise get involved in most regular
Haven activities such as patrols.

Higher powers can only own one house and one shop.

The 'summoning' ritual can be used to teleport a higher power to your location
as long as you have a 'binding circle' place in that location. For some time
the higher power is trapped and unable to use most of their powers or abilities.
If someone else joins the binding circle place the higher power can act against
them however and anyone in the room can use 'break circle' to ruin the circle
and unleash the higher power.

It is permissible to play a higher power and another high tier and/or supernatural
character at the same time. It is also permissible for your other characters to
be worshipers/servants/minions etc of your higher power but not the other way around.
That is your PC can work in the interests of your higher power, your higher power
cannot work in the interests of your PC.

represent ways in which your character's story can grow and develop. For
example one person may want their character to obtain the reward of getting
to feel powerful, while another wants the reward of getting to feel morally
strong so they can do a scene in which one character is more powerful and
wins conflicts, but the other character's moral strength is tested and holds
up.

Characters with compatible narrative rewards will be more likely to be matched
for destinies and those matching narrative rewards will be shown to both
characters whenever a destiny scene starts between them.

Text Characters are given a solidity score, the average solidity of players
in a room impacts the Karma gain of SRs and the adventure application score
of PCs. Solidity is basically a measure of how real your character is, do
they have a few hours under their belt, a bit of faction esteem, a bit of
social activity, some indication they spend a decent proportion of their
time in non sexual RP etc. 
  
Age, spent rp exp, time since applying to an adventure, number of unique 
outfits, a couple of other things in a similar vein all effect your 
solidity score.

Text Creating a society is a multi-step process; first, you should come up with a theme for your society and think about what change it is they're looking to enact upon the world, even if it is just locally. Once you have a theme in mind, you can then use the following commands to work your way through the creation process:
 
`c[`WMandatory Commands`c]`g:`x
  `cSyntax`g:`W `WCult`D/`WSect`x create `g(`xname`g)`x
    Create a new society by the name specified. Costs at least `W25`g,`W000`x influence between standard and scheme. The first `W25`g,`W000`x influence returns `g$`W25`g,`W000`x in resources, but up to `W125`g,`W000`x influence can be spent for a maximum of `g$`W75`g,`W000`x in starting resources.
 
`x `c Syntax`g: `WCult`D/`WSect`x `g(`xfield`g)`x
    Enter the editor to edit the description in `WCult`D/`WSect`x info `g(`xsociety`g)`x. Valid fields are summary, manifesto, missions, history, roles, scenes, and ooc.
 
  `cSyntax`g:`W `WCult`D/`WSect`x symbol `g(`xstring`g)`x
    Sets your society's symbol to the string; see the symbol section in '`Whelp customize`x'.
 
  `cSyntax`g:`W `WCult`D/`WSect`x positions `g(`xposition`g)`x `g(`xstance`g)`x
    Sets the society's political and philosophical positions; see `Whelp society positions`x.

  `cSyntax`g:`W `WCult`D/`WSect`x restriction `g(`xrestriction/soft`g)`x
    Sets the society's restrictions; see `Whelp society restrictions`x.

  `cSyntax`g:`W `WCult`D/`WSect`x develop `g(`xasset name`g)`x
    Develop society assets. See `Whelp society assets`x.

  `cSyntax`g:`W `WCult`D/`WSect`x soldiername `g(`xstring`g)`x
    Assign your society's NPC soldiers a short description.

  `cSyntax`g:`W `WCult`D/`WSect`x soldierdescribe`x
    Enter the editor to describe your soldiers in greater detail.

`c  Syntax`g: `W`WCult`D/`WSect`x makeeidolon `g(`xDemon/Fae/Divine/Ghost/Cthulian/Primal`g) (`WName`g)`x

    Toggle whether your society will accept alts.
  
  `cSyntax`g:`W `WCult`D/`WSect`x makeenemy `g(`x1-10`g)`x
    Enter the editor to describe potential NPC enemy groups for your society; these can be extant antagonist societies such as the Heralds or Hunters, antagonistic subfactions, or entirely virtualised groups of your own design.
 
  `cSyntax`g:`W `WCult`D/`WSect`x oppose `g(`x1-10`g)`x `g(`xsociety`g)`x
    Make an offer to become enemies with another society in the specified enemy slot; this must be followed by the `Wsociety approveenemy`x command shown below. When societies are enemies, they become vulnerable to one another, as if they are weaknesses - this makes it easier for members to nightmare pull, dream invade, dream snare, commit, and abduct one another.

  `cSyntax`g:`W `WCult`D/`WSect`x unoppose `g(`x1-10`g)`x/`g(`xsociety`g)`x
    Unlike `Wsociety oppose`x, this does not require approval; it removes an extant enemy relationship.
 
  `cSyntax`g:`W `WCult`D/`WSect`x approveenemy `g(`xsociety`g)`x
    Approve an enemy relationship between societies.
 
  `cSyntax`g:`W `WCult`D/`WSect`x resist `g(`xnumber`g)`x `g(`xsociety`g)`x
    Available to virtuous societies only, this enables the society to claim an enemy slot without approval, but is a one-way relationship; the resisting society becomes vulnerable to the society being resisted, and in exchange they receive free resources.
 
  `cSyntax`g:`W `WCult`D/`WSect`x stasis`x
    Puts a society into stasis, where it will begin to recover secrecy; full secrecy should be restored within `W3`x months.
 
  `cSyntax`g:`W `WCult`D/`WSect`x unstasis `g(`xsociety name`g)`x
    Takes a society out of stasis.

Text Haven paints naturals with an aura when they arrive, only visible to
those with nightmare charms.  They start off green, and eventually turn to
blue-green, then blue, before it fades.  Auras help supernaturals determine
how to treat naturals, if someone has a green aura they may just be passing
through, and it's important for the lore that the supernatural be kept from
them.  As the aura changes however, it indicates someone's been there a long

Text Masterminds are the PCs who are driving a particular storyline. If the 
storyline reaches a high enough level of completion with the mastermind 
being used heavily in most of the activity that has powered it, the 
storyline can use two different types of finale: ascension and tyranny.
 
Ascension allows the mastermind to move up a tier by completing a 
crisis event and spending karma, allowing them to bypass normal tier 
restrictions. Ascended PCs are considered one tier higher than normal 
for all purposes, including how monstrous/villainous they are.
 
Tyranny allows the mastermind to become a Tyrant of Haven, gaining huge 
powers over all other PCs, including the ability to use breaksanctuary 
on anyone, or have people detained at very low cost. Tyrants can be 
overcome with a special type of operation called 'psychic.' This 
operation is not based on faction, with characters instead signing up 
for or against the target. The target gains a bunch of soldiers to defend 
themselves, but if they win the amount of soldiers they gain goes down 
by half each successive attempt.
 
PCs wishing to reach ascension or tyrant must be featured as a mastermind 
in at least 3-4 of the plots involved in the storyline, and the storyline 
must reach 200%. If ascending, they will ascend as soon as the crisis 
scheme fires. NPCs can serve as the "go between" for the mastermind and 
the PCs on the plots, but the mastermind should not be obfuscated in any way.
 
PCs that have been put into stasis can still be used as masterminds. 
Operations and encounters can also have a mastermind set, if the activity 
in question makes sense for the storyline.

sufficient enough supernatural power over the target.  Characters need to be
either in a society or a supernatural with some level or arcane ability or
hypnotism to use supernatural lures at all.  Supernatural lures also cost 1%

Type 0
Text Society positions define the political and philosophical positions of
societies.  Societies are groups who join together in order to change the
world in different ways, the noparticipate option for societies allows you
to create societies which have no such ambitions for the world, but
generally people would not even form a society if they were not interested
in such and simply continue on as individuals, or join a society they don't
believe in just for the support and protection and pay.  Similar to how
normal people frequently work in jobs they don't believe in for the pay.  

Societies without any real goals, or with goals that would be pursued by
people even if the group did not exist, have a hard time attracting backing
from the wider supernatural community, similar to how a political party
might not get many donations if they had no manifesto or their manifesto was
for people to people to shower regularly.  

`cPro-Supernatural`W:`x

These societies want to make things better for supernatural people compared
to mundanes.  It might be that they believe supernaturals currently have
things worse and their efforts are to try and balance things out, but
especially at higher levels of belief, is more often about wanting to make
mundanes more of a second class citizen.  They may encourage shadow
supernatural governments that manipulate the mundane government, or endorse
supernatural laws that make using powers against mundanes legal.  

`cAnti-Supernatural`W:`x

The inverse of the pro-supernatural groups these want to make things better
for mundanes compared to supernaturals.  Sometimes because they think
they're worse off, other times because they just want humans to be better
off.  They typically try to endorse supernatural laws that strictly prohibit
the use of supernatural abilities on normal people, and may even want to
keep watch lists of supernaturals and treat them as criminals.  

`cSpiritual`W:`x

These groups typically want to see technology play a smaller role in
people's lives compared to more traditional or spiritual activities.  They
are generally opposed to dense urban centers and want significant
restrictions or oversight on new technological development.  They are also
often opposed to free market capitalism, and industrial development.  

`cMaterial`W:`x

These groups usually want more technological and industrial development. 
They are usually for free market capitalism and want less hurdles in the way
of scientific and financial progress.  While they are not necessarily
anti-environment they usually promote more planned, scientific approaches to
environmental problems.  

`cCombative`W:`x

These groups want to see combat or direct conflict resolve differences. 
This usually means less complicated laws with people having more
responsibility to protect themselves as well as not prohibiting violence as
a means of conflict resolution in the supernatural world.  Combatively
powerful individuals are usually given more important positions within the
shadow governments they form.  Their shadow governments are also usually
very martial in design.  

`cManipulative`W:`x

These groups want to see combat used less for conflict resolution and
instead have legal procedures, diplomacy or social manipulation used.  They
tend to have harsher rules against open violence, but more evolved
procedures for dealing with problems or attacking enemies with legal, social
or diplomatic measures.  Clever and cunning individuals are usually given
more important positions within the shadow governments they form.  

`cCorrupt`W:`x

These groups believe in and support inequality, with more privileges and
power going to a select few, either certain types of people or members of
that society and their allies.  They believe it is the right of the strong
to rule over and do with the weak as they wish and that it is the role of
the weak to help support the strong.  Their shadow governments typically run
on the back of what is effectively slavery and what laws the do have will
only exist to protect their chosen few from the masses and never the
reverse.  

`cVirtuous`W:`x

These groups support equality, they tend to fight for efforts to ensure all
people have the same basic rights and protections and that laws and systems
are put in place to ensure that the weak and vulnerable are protected from
being preyed upon.  They often influence their territories to be more
socially progressive.  

`cAutocratic`W:`x

These groups support inequality in government, generally supporting
dictatorships, oligarchies, aristocracies and similar systems of
determination in which a few decide for the many.  

`cDemocratic`W:`x

These groups support equality in decision making, generally supporting
various types of democracy both in their own organizations and in the
territories they control.  

`cAnarchistic`W:`x

These groups tend to support very little law, both in the supernatural world
and the territories they control.  Usually very anti-regulation and
supporting of smaller governments with more individual freedom and
determination.  

`cLawful`W:`x

These groups tend to support very robust legal systems and regulations both
in the supernatural world and in territories they control.  This might still
mean that in a corrupt society mundanes and weaker individuals have no
rights or legal protections, but it will mean those that do have legal
protections will have very stringent and robust forms.  

`cNeutral`W:`x

When a society is neutral on a particular position that means they wish
things to stay as they are.  They will generally fight against efforts to
change things by either other side and will work to establish infrastructure
that makes that change more difficult.

Text Cardinals are a blanket term supernatural and anti-supernatural society use to describe beings capable of sin magic. Sin magic casters come from all walks of life; there have been even humans throughout the years capable of sin magic, though most the time it's supernaturals, especially those who've developed hypernatural abilities. 
 
There are several ways Cardinals are made. Some get their hands on powerful magicks and become Cardinals through sheer study. Others have sin spirits, called Maleficarum and their opposite, Justiciarum, bound to them. Still others are possessed by these sin spirits. Maleficarum were created by demons during the rise of Christianity, utilizing sin magic and teaching their followers so that they'd be better able to affect the world outside Hell. How Justiciarum came to be is still a mystery, as their sole goal seem to be helping people get over their sins, ultimately protecting them from Cardinals they're vulnerable to.
 
There is a signficant amount of Maleficarum compared to Justiciarum. This is mostly due to various purges and collaboration between more corrupt Cardinals in an effort to ensure they remain mostly unopposed and have many vulnerable targets.
 
Whatever their origins, Cardinals have many different powers. Their most common is the ability to read the minds and memories of those vulnerable to them, as well as various psychic abilities that allow them to easily alter the minds of others. Some Cardinals have control over the weather, and in Haven especially, the mists and shadows. Others seem to be able to control animals, though rarely more than one kind. Incidentally, the vulnerability a person has to a Cardinal works both ways -- most individuals cannot significantly hurt Cardinals unless they are also vulnerable to them.
 
`cCode Considerations`g:`x Cardinals are allowed to make societies without having to wait until the 20th of the month. However, Cardinals themselves cannot attend any operations but the psychic ones that target them specifically. Cardinals are not counted towards the villainy system, as they already have enhanced life force. As Cardinals are a guest type only staff can play, when a character turns story off, Cardinals cannot enter any scene with that character. Characters with story off who enter scenes with Cardinals in them can interact with Cardinals, but as long as they follow the rules in `Rhelp story death`x, cannot be affected by the Cardinal in any meaningful way.
 
`cPsychic Operations`g:`x When signing up for a psychic operation, you can sign up to defend the Cardinal or attack the Cardinal. Those who defend the Cardinal will fight alongside a pool of minions who will rush the attacking team. If the operation is successful, the Cardinal falls into a coma for a minimum of six weeks, though this period is often extended as another Cardinal replaces them or the Cardinal is killed while in a coma. Any societies the Cardinal controls are destroyed. If the operation fails, another can't be launched for roughly a week and the Cardinal loses half their minions the next assault.

`c2`W)`x Dreamworlds need to have continuity, while people may not always exactly

into future events.  

`c3`W)`x Dreamworlds must be able to support plots.  Dreamworld owners do not have
to run plots in their worlds, but the world should have enough depth to
support them if they wish to.  

`c4`W)`x Dreamworlds must have a role that can be taken by an ordinary human
character wandering into the world.  i.e. Some form of new arrival role.  

`c5`W)`x Dreamworlds must be believable realities.  Generally this means they
should have some sort of history, lore, laws of physics etc which make sense
within the confines of the world and do not rely on PCs of NPCs acting in
ways that make no sense or are clearly OOCly driven.  

`c6`W)`x Dreamworlds need to be sufficiently detailed that a new player could
start RPing in them without needing OOC help.  If they rely on outside
canons, they must be common enough for any query to be answered quickly and
readily by an internet search and it should be clear what canon they are
relying upon.

Text `WSyntax:`x Victimize (target) (option)
`WSyntax`x: Become Difficult Prisoner

When used without a target, victimize will list all the possible options. 
The victimize command allows someone to transfer some life force from a
helpless target to themselves.  Each of the options presents a different way
to torment the victim, which will occur the next time the user uses an
emote.  

The victim will then get a list of options of how to respond, and inputs a
number to select which one they will use, which also occurs on their next
emote.  Victimize always costs the victim the same amount of life force, but
how much is transferred depends on the response chosen, with earlier, lower
number responses transferring more.  

The victim has two minutes to make a response, and then 15 minutes to pick
an emote.  If they do not make a response, stoic unresponsive will be chosen
for them.  If they do not write an emote it will be processed as if they
did.  Stoic unresponsive will always fire immediately, not requiring an
emote.  

If a victim chooses the stoic unresponsive option twice in a row, they will
immediately transfer as much life force as they could over a prolonged scene
at a limited rate and be flagged as a difficult prisoner.  Typing `gbecome
difficult prisoner`x will also flag you this way, but has a slightly higher
cost.  Difficult prisoners slowly drain the life force from anyone
roleplaying with them while they are helpless and this flag lasts for three
days.  

Using the pass out option similarly transfers as much life force as could be
transferred over a prolonged scene, but does not flag the victim as being a
difficult prisoner.  

Lower tier victims provide less life force and characters will also obtain
less when using the same victimize options repeatedly.  When using victimize
options that are not themselves mean, they will instead add to the amount
transferred on the next mean action.  Supernaturals of higher tier than
their victims transfer lifeforce twice as fast as mundane's given their
ability to also feed on psychic distress.  

Any victims in the institute will lose life force as if being fed upon by a
supernatural, but their persecutor will only gain it as if they were human. 
They will also gain standing in the institute however.  While no official
comment has been made by the White Oak Corporation confirming this
practice, most figure their discreet promotion of the practice has something
to do with this missing life force.  

Attempting to OOCly influence the choices victims or persecutors make, or
attempting to insult or shame players after the fact for the choices they
make, including difficult prisoner choices is a violation of the rules and
will be treated harshly.  
 
Less lifeforce can be obtained through Victimize if the target is being
victimized in the dream scape.

Text The weakness relationship allows a character to denote another as their
particular psychological weakness.  

Characters with a weakness are more psychological resiliant in general, they
cost 3x as much to commit, are immune to nightmare pull or dream
invasion/snaring and are much less likely to be successfully abducted.  

Being someone's weakness is however more psychologically onerous, they cost
3x less to commit, half as much to nightmare pull or dream invade/snare and
are much more likely to be successfully abducted.  

The character with the weakness will also share in the suffering of their
weakness, they take any life force losses the other char suffers multiplied
by 1.  5 times, and suffer pentalties to their lifeforce if their weakness
is wounded, helpless, committed, or dream snared.  

You may make an employee PC your weakness, you can not otherwise make a PC
of your own your weakness.  

Weakness status is lost if the weakness charcter is not being actively
played.  

You will not be considered having a weakness if your weakness is inside the
institute and not a patient.  

The Praestes Relationship is codely identical to the weakness relationship,
but ICly represents a connection brought about through conscious mystical
means instead of natural emotional dependence.  Some sort of ritual is used
to create a connection that then protects one individual at the expense of
the other.  

Characters with the sensitive stat are always considered to be a weakness.
 
Societies can claim enemies which may also consider their enemies weaknesses.

of the other accessible worlds.

District 82 - Hell
Lauriea - The Other
Rhagost - The Godrealms
Navorost - The Wilds

These territories will always rapidly revert back to a contested
state whenever not contested or in open war. Establishing a
foothold in one of these territories will convey special advantages
as the controlling society exerts great influence on those wishing
to travel between that world and Earth.

The leader of any society who controls a border territory gains
a special fame line noting them as a border lord.

The society which controls the Wilds border territory gains an extra
$5, 000 resource in plunder per week.

The leader of the society which controls the Other is sent two potions
each month, drinking these potions grants the ability to use the invis
command to turn completely invisible whenever not in combat to other PCs.

The leader of the society which controls the Godrealms is sent two
potions each month, drinking these potions grants the immortality stat
as well as significant resistance to abduction owing to skin that is
very difficult to penetrate with a needle.

The leader of the society which controls Hell is sent two potions each
month, drinking these potions grants the hellfire discipline. A 100 range
sorcerous discipline.

Potions are always sent out on the first of each month, the effects last
for 14 days after they are taken.

once a week and arcanists can see if a property currently has a door to the
market with shop info.

The market contains a supernatural library, as well alchemical laboratories,
engineering facilities and magical workshops for characters to use. It is
also the home of a bazaar where most supernatural goods are traded.

The goblin market is a hub of supernatural news and gossip, characters can
post IC notes to 'market' in order to make them visible to any characters
who've visited the market since they were posted.

Doors into the goblin market are only visible to and usable by characters
with society symbols or by Institute staff.

The goblin market also contains a small bar, an area for dueling/sparring
and a fleshformer. The fleshformer requires payment in human infant hearts
however, fortunately those can usually be purchased in the bazaar.

A living Nightmare is a type of guest that can only be created when a monster 
guest is deleted after reaching maturity. This allows them to be born into 
the physical plane as a living nightmare. Living nightmares can be created at
any point after the monster guest is deleted, as each one takes different
amounts of time to manifest. It may be minutes, or it may be years later.
 
Living Nightmares appear as normal humans or supernaturals and can be of any 
regular archetype. They can join societies and participate in all regular 
activities although as guests they have some limits on wealth and similar 
exploitable stats. They appear to have sanctuary however they really do not.
  
Living Nightmares cannot abduct people, their mere presence disturbs sleep.
  
Living Nightmares can use the murder command in the form `gmurder (victim)`w on
a helpless target. This causes a massic psychic failing which manifests in the 
living as systemic organ failure and in the undead as a loss of physical 
cohesion. The result is that after about 1 hour of active play time, the 
victim will die. This can be somewhat prolonged with medical care, but cannot 
be stopped or reversed.
 
The Living Nightmare feeds on the suffering and fear produced by these deaths, 
the player gaining karma based on the roleplay done by the victim in their 
final hours.
 
The Living Nightmare must earn 15k rpxp before using the murder command, and 
another 15k rpxp between each successive use.

`WSyntax:`x Stasis (charactername)/Unstasis (name)

Stasis is used to put societies and/or characters temporarily out of play.
While out of play the secrecy penalty associated with being active will
decrease at the same rate it previously increased. If a society or character
is in stasis for at least three months for a society or six weeks for a 
character, all previous penalties will be shed, no matter how long they were 
active for. Additionally societies will shed all ex-member penalties if in 
stasis at least three months.
 
Societies can only be brought out of stasis by exmembers or characters from
the same account as the individual who put it into stasis, they are also the
only ones who can see it on the society list.
 
When a character is put into stasis, they will get their xp and rpxp returned
just like if they deleted the character, spent non-personal karma will also
go into their bank. In order to unstasis the character, the player must have
unspent xp and rpxp equal to what was returned, as well as enough personal
karma and regular + banked karma for the character's tier. Characters are
brought back from stasis from the login screen where one would normally
choose a character to play.
 
Characters in stasis at least 6 weeks will lose all secrecy penalties.
Stasis characters cannot be abducted.
 
Stasis characters retain their dream xp, influence and world xp.
 
New societies cannot be created or old ones brought out of stasis before the 
20th of each month.  
 
A character can elect to enter stasis in another world, other, wilds, hell, godrealm.
If they do so they will be able to continue playing that character while in stasis, but
will be unable to leave that world at all, or take part in society activities.

Text Almost all societies in the supernatural world will join together in an
alliance. While each society is ultimately out for themselves they recognize
that it is in their best interest to have allies. Alliances are formed around
the different positions that societies take, but often have different break
points between where someone would be considered on one side of a conflict
versus when they would be considered on another side.

Alliances usually change about once every six months, no society wants to
remain stuck in an alliance so long that their fates become permanently
entwined with the other groups.

Alliances are determined by code and reshuffled every six months according
to what alliance would bring the greatest balance. All territories will have
their alliance control percentages reset when the alliances are reshuffled.

Members of the same alliance will be part of the same team on operations and
in warfare/arcane warfare patrols. They also share the same communication
channel used with ssay.

Text Restrictions allow societies to limit what types of individuals can join them.
More restricted societies have bonuses to their secrecy as they are more
challenging to infiltrate.

A society gains 3% secrecy bonus if no other society has that restriction,
2% if another society has the restriction but has set it more recently and
1% otherwise.

Restricting naturals, supernaturals, or people with any combat, arcane or
professional focuses gives a bonus 2% each.

Using society restriction soft allows a society to toggle their restrictions
to soft restrictions. Soft restrictions allow a restricted character to
join a society but they are limited to standing 1-2, and cannot be given
any important trusts or become a leader. Essentially functioning as a
slave/servant/intern class.

Soft restrictions reduce bonuses to 3%, 1.5% and 0.5%.

Text In order for societies to achieve their goals they need to operate with a degree
of secrecy. Their resources and assets need to be hidden away so they can use
them effectively without being countered, and then brought forth again in a way
that nobody suspects until it is too late.

Secrecy is an attribute that both societies and characters posses. It affects
the rate at which resources are gained and spent. When a character generates
resources for a society, the amount will be reduced by half for every 20% below
100% secrecy level of the society and the character, or doubled for every 40%
above 100% secrecy level of the society and character, stacking multiplicitively.

When spending resources the same occurs, although the effect of the charcter
halved. Also some forms of spending resources do not take the character into
account those that involve ordering something done instead of doing it themselves.

The secrecy of a society is determined by:
The average tier of its members, societies with average tier below 2.5 gaining
bonuses, and those above gaining penalties.

The rarity of its positions. Societies with positions further away from the
average position of other societies receive expoential bonuses to their secrecy
the further away they are. If two societies have exactly the same positions
on everything they receive significant secrecy debuffs.

Their restrictions. Societies gain secrecy bonuses the more restrictions they
have, particularly if no other societies have those restrictions or they are
the olders society with them.

Exmembers, anyone who left the society after attaining at least standing two
causes a secrecy penalty as long as they are active.

Days active, the longer a society is active the lower its secrecy. This can
be reset however by putting a society into stasis.

The secrecy of a character is determined by:
The tier of the character, tier 1s have a base secrecy of 100%, T2s 100%,
T2.5s 90%, T3s 80%, T4s 60%, T5s 40%.

Recent activity, the more a character has contributed or used resources in the
last two weeks, the lower their secrecy.

Roleplaying in public hotspots with characters who are T1 or T2 will improve
your secrecy, particularly offsetting penalties caused by contributing/using
resources. More bonuses are given for lower tier character who are humans,
local archetypes, or the only active character on an account.

Days active, the longer a character is active the lower their secrecy. This
can be reset however by putting the character into stasis.

Dreamworlds are an exception where dice were implemented to accommodate stat

dreamworlds easier to create since many players are most familiar with games
that utilize dice rolling.

to set up/run their scenes.  

`r*`W)`x You should not post fixed or corrected emotes, if you need to fix an
error and cannot do so ICly you should do it with a small follow up
clarifying statement.  Do not repeat the whole emote again.

You should not color all your emotes.  You should not overwrite people's
color say preferences with colored speech in your emotes.

`r*`W)`x You should not include any 'meta commentary' in your emotes remarking on
events as if you were a narrator talking about the scene.  This is
especially true of passive aggressive commentary such as.  "Bob ignores
@person and their stupid shoes."  

`r*`W)`x You should not write the result of an action which may be contested
unless the result has been determined by some coded feature of the game such
as a compete or combat.  

`r*`W)`x You should not use emotes to control NPCs in any way that aids your
character or their agenda unless they are professional NPCs simply doing
their job, such as bodyguards or shopkeepers.  

`r*`W)`x You may not delierately damage the immersion or reality of ongoing
roleplay with your emotes.  Such as by deliberately focusing attention on
any coded aspect of the game unequal to the task of representing a reality
or on interpretations of coded events that are notably less sensible than
other interpretations.  

You can use `greport (person)`x if you feel they are violating these standards,

Text Oppression is a powerful curse that societies can levy against unprotected
targets.  Nobody who is either a society member or a vassal can be targeted
by an oppression curse so long as their society has sanctuary protection. Unless
they previously quit the society doing the curse while higher than standing 1
and when the society had loyalty enforcement developed.
  
Oppression curses can only be removed by someone with commanding trust in the
society that placed it.  

`WSociety oppress (target)`x will place a curse.  
`WSociety unoppress (target)`x will lift one.  

Once the curse has been placed even joining or being vassaled by another
society will not remove the effects.  

Oppression curses weaponize bad luck, causing the victim's things to be
stolen or break, making them much more likely to have accidents or be
discriminated against.  It usually only takes a few weeks for an oppression
curse to reduce someone to complete destitution if it is not lifted.  
 
Oppression curses cost around $4000 - $5000 resources.

Text The Villainy system keeps track of how scary higher tier characters are.
A coded function keeps track of villainous activities people engage in
while villainy praises and disses allow PCs in the game to indicate
who they find particularly intimidating or scary or particularly
non intimidating/scary.

Every two weeks the highest rated character and lowest rated character
will have rumors based on their praises and disses with the highest
rated also having a chance to get a villainy buff for the next two weeks,
increasing their life force and life force regeneration as well as adding
a message to their look info.

Praises and disses are the most heavily weighted part of the system, with
penalties for repeatedly using them on the same individuals, the coded
system acts as a check to prevent people getting either buffed or debuffed
from praises/disses alone if they seem highly inconsistant with the coded
evaluation.

Characters who've done particularly well can get a +1 or -1 to the % of
karma they get back upon deleting/rerolling or lowering their tier, up
to a maximum of 15%. Staff can add or subtract a further 5%. Making
the total range possible 60-100%.

If a character is already at the minimum level and receive this penalty they
will take a life force debuff instead, if already at the maximum and get
this bonus they'll recieve some karma instead.

All other T3s or higher with at least 100 hours will be reported in the news
every two weeks as particularly monsterous or corrupt individuals.

Use praise/diss (person) villainy (message) to do a villain praise or
diss, this costs no influence but can only be done once every two weeks
and this cooldown is account based. You should use this command ICly
to represent those your character finds particularly intimidating or
particularly not-intimidating for their archetype/tier.

So for instance you might praise someone because they did something mean
to you, you heard stories about them, or even because of the intimidating
way in which they carry themselves or act. You might diss someone for being
weak, nice, or silly.

Text While inside the dreamscape characters do not realise that they are
dreaming, or that the world they're in is not real.  Drives, desires and
situations from the real world frequently do manifest into their dreams, but
not as something external.  

For instance if you go into the dreamscape wishing to be a bird, you will
probably dream about being a bird and flying around, but you won't be aware
that you're not a real bird and this isn't a real world, at least not until
you wake up.  Or if you fall asleep in the bathtub, may well end up in a
swamp or other damp locale in your dream.  

Similarly if you go into the dreamscape with the intention of delivering a
message about yourself or someone else being held captive you might dream
about being a soldier sent to deliver their commanding office intelligence
about someone being held captive by the Nazis, or yourself be a recently
released POW.  

People can sometimes use this to piece together events in real life, if
someone has a single theme of captivity running through all their dreams
when others encounter them frequently they might guess in the waking world
that that person is a captive, they might also be able to guess who they are
by other recurring themes in their dream identities.  They wouldn't of
course realise this in the dream however, since they also wouldn't know it
was a dream until they awoke.  

Characters do have much sharper memories of the dreams they have in the
dreamscape after they awake compared to normal dreams.  

The creation of dreamworlds is a conscious, psychic exercise generally done
while awake or in a semi-sleeping state.  Characters are aware they've built
a psychic realm and have consciously chosen each of its features.  Characters
can while awake plan who they will be in a certain world when they fall
asleep, and focus on that desire in order to make it manifest.  But it
doesn't always work, sometimes their subconscious works against their wishes
to choose a different identity for them.  

The details around how someone came to be in that place in the dream world
or whatever other parts of their backstory that are difficult to explain
will be fuzzy and hard for the dreamer to recall.  If a dreamer does somehow
realise they are dreaming, they will immediately wake back up.

The attacker and anyone with them will also fall asleep and appear
as spirits in the nightmare. Members of both opposing alliances with
the warfare habit will get an alert, allowing them to also join the
conflict with patrol engage.

The nightmare is intially particularly chaotic, and the fight
cannot begin for some time as the attackers search for the victim inside it.
Both sides are free to RP during this period, they cannot see each other but
will be able to hear each other.  The attacker can also pause in the search
to prolong the RP period and the victim can force the fight to start at any

the battle characters on both sides can use patrol pledge to devote some of
their life force to the conflict, every time they do so they can also add an

You identify a potential target, normally this means someone with the

unsafe areas.  You will see the target's intro or whatever you have them
remembered as and then have a chance to attempt to go after them.  If
successful you and the target are both moved into an instanced room, the
target can then attempt to either flee from you, hide from you, or attack
you.  If they attack normal combat begins, if they hide then you begin
searching for them.  While hidden you cannot see them, but can hear them,
and they can see and hear you.  If they run you will get a period of time in
which you can RP the chase before either grabbing them or them escaping

Targets can switch between fleeing and hiding as they go.  After they've
been grabbed you can subdue them, or they can squirm free to begin the
process anew.  Characters who squirm free however will often leave something
behind in your grasp.  
 
You can use `cpatrol prey (character name)`x to target a predator patrol at
a specific character. This only works on characters who are reckless or a weakness.

Text `WSyntax:`x Patrol

Patrols are a system to generate RP encounters with other players.  You must
first set your patrol habits with the habit command, see help patrol habits.
Then use patrol to toggle being on patrol.  There are five types of patrol;
Hunting, which means your character spends some time going after
particularly dangerous monsters in the outer forest.  Warfare, which means
your character attempts to attack their society's enemies.  Arcane, which
means your character will attempt to deal with mystical problems in Haven
and launch mystical attacks on their society's enemies.  Diplomatic, which
means your character will attempt to deal with social problems for your
society.  And predator which means your character will attempt to seek out
weaker characters to prey upon them, for blood, money, psychic feeding or
other reasons.  

Some types of patrol require you to move around in order to activate the
events, others do not but are aided by you doing such.  

While every patrol event has code to go along with it and may convey coded
advantages or disadvantages from participation, their focus is on RP and
each is designed to have the majority of the time as RP time.  

See the following helps for more information about the types of patrol
events.

Text Monster guests are a type of character that represents monsters from
the nightmare plane who've begun to manifest.  These creatures are much more
powerful than regularly PCs, with 500, 000 exp/rp to spend per tier of their
creator and almost no limits on what stats they can buy.  They cannot take
more than 80 damage per round with the rest going to stagger, there are
limits on how much stagger can impact them, they cannot be affected by most
conventional stuns.

Those 10 feet tall or larger have further reduced stagger effects and double
the defense pool of others but move much slower and cannot enter indoor
areas.  Monsters earn karma for injuring and killing PCs, although there are
some limits to this to prevent abuse.  Monsters begin being stuck in the
nightmare, and cannot nightmare pull anyone else into it.

If a monster gets to a certain number of hours they can leave the nightmare
or delete to allow them to be reborn later as a living nightmare. This
required number of hours starts at 30, but decreases by 1 every time a new
monster is created until one succeeds at transforming.

Monster hours are reset whenever they enter the outer forest, skies, underwater
or go far out into the ocean. Monsters also lose 2 hours every time they log on.

Whenever a monster is on grid all societies with scouts will receive regular
updates about their location.  Monsters can be either sea monsters or land
monsters.  Sea monsters do half damage while on land but can breathe
underwater and fight in aquatic areas without penalty.  

Defeating a monster grants some bonus experience, and also usually an
increase to your combat experience cap, distributed evenly amongst all those
who helped defeat it with a maximum increase of 500000 being awarded.  

Monsters can use the 'seek' command to find possible nearby prey, this
command preferences high tier characters.  

Monsters cannot use abduct or execute commands until they are at 100 hours. 
 
Monsters can use `gdreamworld associate (number)`x to choose their world of
origin, doing so will make them more difficult to kill but give characters
with experience in that world some advantages in combat against them.

This stat unlocks the swarm genus type for shapeshifters. This allows shifters to turn into a group of animals, with larger groups necessitating a smaller size of individual creature. Swarm shifters can never take more damage in one hit than a proportion equivalent to their remaining number. So if you have five animals in your swarm, you cannot take more than `W1`g/`W5`xth of your life in a single hit. 

As a trade-off, however, your damage is also reduced by the proportion of your remaining defence. For example, if you have `W25`g/`W100`x DF, you will deal `W25`g%`x of your normal damage, whereas if you have `W10`g/`W200`x DF, you will deal `W5`g%`x of your normal damage.
 
This also gives `g+`W5`x to animal shapeshifting pools, to a minimum of `W15`x.

`WTiny`x creatures are a swarm of `W16`x individuals.
`WSmall`x creatures are a swarm of `W8`x individuals.
`WSmall-Medium`x creatures are a swarm of `W4`x individuals.

Characters can lose lifeforce by being wounded, harvested or fed upon by
vampires or psychic predators.  They can also expend it to power magical
objects or spells or some other supernatural abilities.  

Character's physically older than 60 have reduced lifeforce, as do
vampires in the daytime, supernaturals without either sanctuary protection
or a strong society, those who engage in more dream sex than real sex and
maimed characters.  

Characters with a demonic pact who have not engaged in much antagonism will

Text Stagger is a debuff that appears next to your defense in your prompt.  It
represents a general lack of balance or short term fatigue in combat.  All
attacks add some stagger when they strike you, but the amount depends on the
conditions of the attack.  Most supernaturals will take bonus stagger from
certain types of weapons to which they have a weakness.  

Stagger decreases your damage and movement speed, and is particularly
effective at diminishing the effect of in combat magical abilities.  It goes
down every round and goes down more the less you've moved that round as well
as the higher your stamina is.  

An attack needs to do at least 10 damage to inflict stagger. Forest monsters
inflict 5 stagger every attack regardless of damage.

Text To travel offworld generally requires finding a place in Haven's outer
forest where you can slip between this world and another.  These paths are
usually hard to find until you stumble onto one, but once found can be
fairly reliably rediscovered.  Coming back from another world to Haven works
in a similar fashion, although a type of magic protects against just anyone
from finding the paths back, only those with a special bone compass item can
return.  Paths between Haven and Hell do exist, but they are sealed off by
what looks to be a barrier of thorns and branches from the side of Haven. 
This barrier can be broken down, although doing so is rarely wise.  It also
reforms fairly rapidly and cannot be broken down from the other side.  

Horses can be ridden to and from other worlds, but no other type of vehicle
can make the journey.  Once in another world either pathing or horse riding
is needed to get around.  

Sorcery tends to be stronger in other worlds, but technology is much less
reliable.  Firearms still generally work but automatic and semi-automatics
in particular are often prone to failing, most people prefer to take
revolvers and bolt-action rifles on trips offworld.

to show up.  You can use command allies attack/follow/atwill (target) to

When using the travel path command, the location is one of the numbers along 
side locations in roomlist. For example: travel pathing 1.
 
Pathing is the main way in which supernaturals travel around the world, and
is particularly useful in other worlds where modern means of transportation
aren't available.  Building a path takes several minutes, but once it's done
even long distances can be traveled quite quickly.  When pathing it appears
as if you are walking or running along a path through a dark forest.  While
leaving the path is possible in theory, those who do so have never been seen
again.  Pathing conflicts with the nightmare, and you cannot path from within
the nightmare.  
 
`cSyntax`g:`W path `g(`Wperson`g)`w
 
At level 3 characters can use pathing in combat to cover any distance and get 
to their target instantly.  This only works if they are not in the nightmare
however.
 
`cSyntax`g:`W path `g(`Wdirection`g)`w
 
At level 4 characters can use pathing to walk through walls, although after 
each use they must wait a long time before using it again and cannot bring 
anyone with them.  What's more if a character attempts to use pathing to walk 
through a wall and there isn't actually anything on the other side, they will 
instantly die.

This stat represents a character's ability to bring psychic forces to bear on convincing people to do as they wish, it is generally much more subtle than hypnotism, can be done more often and doesn't require someone to be put into a trance. Each use of it however costs `W0`g.`W15`g%`x of your life force and the costs to resist are usually much lower and much more affected by environmental factors.  
 
After using the command nothing will initially happen, but when you follow it up with an emote or say that contains the message the persuade will be triggered and will send a message to the target about the attempt which they can then resist or accept. This allows psychic persuasion to be used very subtly as nobody besides the target will even see anything untoward going on. Targets are also ICly unaware when they're being psychically influenced.

`W`cSyntax`g:`W`x Brand (person) (location) (message)
`WExample:`w Brand John neck `Da flaming skull`w
`WAppearance:`w He has a symbol of `Da flaming skull`w on his neck.

Branding is the go to method of choice for more powerful supernaturals to
keep control over less powerful beings and devoted humans. The power
conveys an ability to press their hand against someone's exposed skin and
leave a permanent mark of their symbol there which will appear as 'He/She
has a symbol of (message) on his/her (location)'

It costs the user some amount of life force, generally around 20% for
branding someone of equal power level to yourself. 

When a victim is branded any compulsions, body compulsions, triggered
instructions or triggered body instructions will become sealed in and will
never fade until the brand is removed. Triggered instructions that are
sealed will fade when satiated, but will simply return again once the
trigger occurs once more. 

`cSyntax`g:`W Brand phantom `g(`Wtarget`g) (`Wsensation`g)`w
This command uses the brand link to send a message to someone you have
branded that will appear as 'You feel the sensation of (message). ' Useful
as a easy access tool for disciplining your property. 

`cSyntax`g:`W Brand incapacitate `g(`Wtarget`g)`w
This command sends a surge of pain along the brand link to render your
target temporarily insensible in order to easily recapture property that's
trying to flee. 

`cSyntax`g:`W Brand listen`g/`Wbrand listen stop`w
For about 0. 1% of your life force this command allows you to enter a
state in which you can hear everything any one of your branded can hear. 
Useful for checking on your property to ensure loyalty. 

`cSyntax`g:`W Brand watch`g/`Wbrand watch stop`w
For the truly paranoid human owner, for 2.  5% of your life force you can
enter an even deeper state of obvservation where you also see what they are
doing.  

`cSyntax`g:`W Brand remove`g(`Wtarget`g)`w
Performed in a magical workshop this command allows someone to be
released from a mystical branding. It costs $15, 000 in resources if done
immediately, but the longer the person has had the brand the further the
cost reduces, down to a minimum of $500 at a rate of $10 per
hour, logged in or out.

Text Whenever someone attempts to use either hypnosis or psychic influence on
a target they will have to input a list of three pressures as well as the
message to be followed.  

The target will then see a message about the imprint, including the message
to be followed, they have about five minutes to either resist or accept
before they will accept automatically.  

If they resist they need to enter the three pressures most likely to make
their character succumb to that imprint.  These two lists are then compared,
in the case of hypnosis compulsions if the hypnotizer has perfectly
predicted the resistance imprints the imprint will automatically succeed and
will become locked, permanently sealing in place until someone unlocks it. 

Otherwise the target will be given a cost in life force to resist the
imprint, this cost is higher the better the hypnotizer was able to predict
their vulnerabilities.  They can then either accept the imprint, or resist
it and pay the cost in life force.  If they do this the compulsion
backlashes and hurts the person attempting to influence them, charging them
about half the lifeforce it cost the target in return.  

Other factors can also influence this cost, such as vampire blood, siren
songs, being angelborn, or being drunk.  Generally psychic influence is much
more affected by these secondary factors than hypnosis is.  

For these reasons characters who are particularly successful at influencing
minds need to be adept at understanding and or manipulating the psychology
of their targets, and skilled at picking compulsions that won't be resisted
at any cost by the target's player.  

While in Haven when the Sanctuary spell is up no attempts to supernaturally
control or influence someone to violate sanctuary even against the
unprotected or themselves will fizzle.  If the imprint covers several things
and only some of them are against Sanctuary those others will continue to
work and hold as per normal.

Keyword Attractiveness Lore~

Text In the world of Haven Attractiveness is one of the main tools that
monsters use to manipulate and control people.  

If you've ever wondered why people are more likely to listen to an
endorsement by a pretty celebrity than a learned scientist the answer is
that simply, this is how the monsters want it.  

As most attractive people are either monsters on in league with them
it's in their interests to keep humans hung up on standards of beauty and
adhering to the same set.  As such in the world of Haven physical
attractiveness is not very subjective.  While subjective preferences can
make a small difference in who people find appealing it would never be as
large as a single point on the represented scale out of ten.  Which is to
say that for example no heterosexual woman would find a male who looks to be
a 7 out of ten more attractive than one who looks to be an 8 out of ten. 
This isn't to say they can't find them more attractive overall, just they can't
find them more physically attractive.

Nor can any human ever entirely happily settle for what they have.  A world
in which a human settled down with a partner and then was immune to
temptation would be a boring one for the monsters and so they've ensured
that will never happen.  No matter how happy someone is with a partner or in
a relationship they will always feel a physical attraction and temptation to
those who are more attractive, although that isn't to say they can't resist
it.  

The distribution of attractiveness follows a rough bell curve, with the
average at 5.0 out of ten. At around 8.5 characters are starting to
look as attractive as celebrities and models, by 9.5 they are among some of
the most attractive people in the world.  

Some who learn about the true nature of the world, and that the human
obsession with beauty is an engineered tool of nefarious supernatural forces
designed to keep them under control and easy to manipulate try to resist
conventional standards of beauty, but this has never been successful, the
hooks that have been placed into the human subconscious simply run too deep.
While people can force themselves to act as if they are unaffected by a
pretty face it is never the reality deep down inside and many monsters will
take great joy in proving that to the person.

`c*`x Sexual assault
`c*`x Mutilation
`c*`x Kidnapping from Haven
`c*`x Brainwashing
`c*`x Large Scale Destruction
`c*`x Unwilling exposure to bodily fluids.

Mutilation extends to any forced change to someone that would last for more
than a few days, which can include things like tattooing or even the removal
of hair.  And also extends to inflicting serious woulds that would take a
normal human quite a while to recover from.  

Brainwashing extends to things like the use of a brainwashing facility to
alter people and locking hypnosis compulsions, but not to regular hypnosis
or the alchemical alteration of memories.  

Any attempt to move someone outside of Haven without their consent will be
prevented by Sanctuary.

Any type of large scale destruction such as the detonating of bombs or arson
will be prevented by Sanctuary.  

Turning someone into a werewolf or vampire is counted as a violation.  

While causing pain isn't a violation, it is obviously difficult for many
people to cause much pain without inflicting injuries that would take a
human more than a few days to heal from.

Text Sanctuary is the name of a working of magic that covers the entirety of
Haven and is where the town derives its name.  The Sanctuary spell is
designed to keep all the inhabitants of Haven safe from serious harm,
although it doesn't protect all equally.  

Anyone attempting to do something to a protected person that is against the
rules of the spell will find their body simply unable to follow the commands
to do so.  Someone who attempts to stab a person will find their hand
holding the knife simply hanging casually by their side instead.  It can be
a fairly disconcerting experience for the unaware.  It even extends to those
who try to arrange situations in which a violation is likely to occur.  

Sanctuary also counteracts several types of mind control, any attempt to use
supernatural mind control to cause someone to perform an act that would
violate sanctuary will simply fail if conducted inside Haven.  This happens
even if the target of the mind control and/or the target of their actions
are unprotected.  

All humans are covered by sanctuary, supernaturals however are not unless
they are part of a society which is paying to extend that protection to it's
membership.  Or if someone has used a ritual to temporarily extend
protection to them.  

Character with the fleshform modifier are never protected, nor those who have
been fleshformed in some inhuman way, such as given inhuman features or
abilities. Characters who have recently killed a person also will be without
protection for a time, even if the kill was accidental and/or happened outside
of Haven.  The spell also often takes a while to take hold of new arrivals,
making those who come and go from the town a lot often have spottier protection.  

Individuals in other worlds will have protection from other earth residents,
but not from those who've spent at least 2 days in that other world and
are considered otherworldy residents.

Positive emotions can cause protection to temporarily fail, such as those
caused by sexual encounter or close relationships.  Nobody you have a coded
relationship with will be protected against you or visa versa.  

The Sanctuary spell also protects people from long term harm due to
imprisonment, if prisoners aren't regularly cared for with the `gcarefor`x
command in Haven, the spell will briefly open up a hole through space to
drop them from their cell and into freedom somewhere else.  

People can choose to lower their sanctuary protection, anyone who says the
words "`cRevocacionem protectione sanctuarium`x" will find their protection
disappears until they say "`cRepeto praesidio sanctuarium`x".  Fortunately the
sanctuary spell also protects against mind control compulsions to say one of
these phrases, unfortunately it doesn't protect people again being induced
into do so with threats, blackmail, intimidation, bribery or torture.  
It also prevents the words being said by force through ghost possession.

If someone instead says "`cNullius Minuat sanctuarium`x" their protection will be limited,
only protecting them from death or maiming until they repeal it.
 
See `ghelp Sanctuary Violations`x for an overview of activities the spell
protects against.

Text The roster is a place for people to place characters they've already
built, and in some cases already played, to be then playable by others. 
Almost any type of character can be placed onto the roster, and the amount
of effort and development gone into them is only restricted by the player
who created them.  Several restrictions apply to playing characters from the
roster.  For a long period after you claim them you cannot make very large
changes to them, you cannot get any of their invested resources from them,
and the original author can reclaim them from you.  However after you pass a
certain number of hours, these restrictions all lift and the character
becomes entirely a regular character.  

Once you've played a rostered character for a few hours, or done anything to
alter them you will be unable to take another character off the roster for
one month.  This does not apply if you are the original creator of the
rostered character.  

`WSyntax:`x Roster list
- Displays a list of all rostered characters by name, and a short blurb
about who they are.  

`WSyntax:`x Roster info (number)
- Look at more detailed information on a particular rostered character.  

`WSyntax:`x Roster claim (number)
- Claim a character from the roster for yourself, can only be used from new
character generation.  We suggest using lookup self after claiming a
character to further inspect their history and details.  

`WSyntax:`x Roster deliver
- Send your currently played character to the roster.  Either used when you
took a character off and decided you didn't like them, or when someone wants
to place an original character onto the roster.  

`WSyntax:`x Roster description/introduction
-Used before sending an original character to the roster to set what their
intro on the roster list and their description in roster info will be.  

`WSyntax:`x Roster reclaim (name)
-Used by the creator to take a claimed roster character back if the person
using it isn't doint so in the way you envisoned.  

When a roster character gets to 200 hours it becomes the property of the
current player and can no longer be reclaimed.  At this point the creator
also earns up to 5000 karma, with more being earned for roster characters
claimed by new players.

Text In the world of Haven all types of power come with a cost to your
humanity, this is generally referred to as monstrosity.  More powerful
entities are generally physically and mentally less human, and have had to
sacrifice their morality or aspects of their humanity in order to obtain
that power.  No character can obtain power beyond tier two without hurting
innocent people to obtain it.  RP Prompts for effective Tier 3s and higher
will often ask about who they have hurt, betrayed or sacrificed for their
power.  

Supernatural society is inherently parasitic, with more powerful entities
preying on and feeding off lower power ones.  One of the clearest examples
of this is psychic feeding.  All supernaturals naturally feed from the
psychic energy of sentient beings weaker than they are, the stronger the
being the more powerful the effect.  This can lead to humans who spend a lot
of time around supernaturals ending up particularly weak or frail.  Psychic
feeding is a coded part of the game world.  

At Tier Two, a supernatural character can use the feed command to enhance
their ability to feed from the psychic energies of others in their
surroundings.  They will then slowly siphon off the lifeforce of anyone
nearby and less power than they are who is feeling afraid.

At Tier Three, supernatural characters will feed on fear whether they are
trying to or not, it is now just part of their nature.  Additionally when
they use the feed command to enhance this ability they will also be able to
feed on anger and lust.  This means they will feed on the life force of
those engaged in combat or sex among other things.  Although sparring combat
does generate a fair bit less anger.  Sleeping with a supernatural feeding
on lust can cause a significant transfer of life force.  

At Tier Four, supernatural characters will feed on fear, anger and lust no
matter if they are trying to or not.  It is for instance impossible for
anyone to have sex with such a character without giving up some of their
life force to do so.  They can also use the feed command to enhance their
ability and feed of every character weaker than they are who is in proximity
to them.  

At Tier Five all types of feeding has become automatic.  It is now
impossible to have any personal dealings with an entity this powerful
without slowly being drained of your life force unless you are equally
powerful.  

Supernatural characters at or above T3 who never deliberately feed or do so
sparringly will eventually become ill.  Deliberately feeding on your friends
and allies is a much better way to prevent this than feeding on enemies.  
 
`RSex feeding can take 20+ LF, and may even cause death. If a character is taken below 75% life force they may pass out for a time, or if taken below 60% may even die.`w

Special deputies are individuals deputized by the sheriff's department to
help with the particular supernatural problems that occur when policing a
town such as Haven.  Their job is to cover up any sign of supernatural
goings on or problems inside the town.  It is a fairly unpopular job, as
special deputies are always at risk by being crushed by the supernatural
forces they are trying to juggle, death and burn out are common.  As such
the sheriff's department can be none too picky with it's hiring processes
and many special deputies get their badge with only the most rudimentary of
legal training.  They rarely if ever engage in regular police work, leaving
that to the better schooled if generally less brave regular deputies.  

`WMinimum Age:`x 22

`WAvailable Positive Modifiers:`x Fleshformed, Demonic Pact Holder
Chemically Augmented

`WFocuses:`x Can spend one point in the combat focus family at tier two.  

`WOther:`x Can create badge objects with customize (object name) badge.  Can
open all the locked doors in the sheriff's department and don't need to
obtain another job.  Can listen in on and speak on the 911 emergency
broadcast channel.  

`WDetain:`x Used with Detain (target).  This command sends any non society
character of tier 3 or below to jail for two hours.  Most often used by
special deputies to remove people who are at risk of exposing the
supernaturals to get them away from the public and then deal with the issue
themselves or hand them off to the societies.  

`WDisperse:`x When used in a public room such as a street it forces everyone to
leave within twenty minutes or be detained.  Supernaturals can enter the
nightmare to avoid the detainment.  It is generally used to clear crime scenes
or break up public rows.  

`WMoveAlong:`x When used on someone in a private residence they don't have a key
to it will force them to leave that residence within twenty minutes or be
arrested.  Used most often in the case of trespassing complaints.  
 
`WFrisk`x: When used on someone on the White Oak campus, weapons on their person
will be transported to the evidence cage in the Sheriff's Department.

Text The Treaty of Venice is a set of accords that most groups in the
supernatural world are signatories too.  It lays out a set of common rules
and understandings that allows members of different groups to get along when
they need to.  The treaty was signed in Venice in 1584, replacing the older
Byzantium accords.  

The largest difference between the Treaty of Venice and the Byzantium
accords is the strict rules about the revelation of the supernatural world
to unaware humans and it's no coincidence that this change was made during
the height of the witch trials.  

Under the treaty of Venice any member of the signatory organizations may be
executed if revealing the existence of the supernatural to a human causes
significant harm to any other signatory member.  In modern times this
accusation is difficult to make stick, and generally requires fairly clear
cut examples of someone revealing the supernatural to a human only to have
that human turn to a path of vengeance, supernatural hunting or spreading
the word indiscriminately.  It also doesn't apply if the human goes on to
join a signatory group before doing said harm, allowing organizations like
the Temple to continue recruiting.  

The other main principles of the Treaty are:

Oaths: A member of the supernatural world is considered bound by any oath
they make invoking the Treaty of Venice.  Anyone who violates this oath owes
reparations to the injured party, if they do not pay, their organization
will be compelled to on their behalf.  While formally this involves stating,
I swear by the Treaty of Venice, it is almost always accepted to also simply
say, I give you my Venetian word, or I make a Venetian promise.  

Treaties: Members of different organizations may at times need to work
together, in order to facilitate that the Treaty covers temporary alliances
between different members known as Venetian truces.  Again the general
requirement is to mention the word Venice of Venetian in your proposal of a
truce, as well as to stipulate until when it will last either by a date or
time or by a particular event.  Such as "I offer you a Venetian Truce until
sundown."  Or "Venetian Truce until we catch this guy?"  While under a truce
any hostile actions are considered violations.  A failure to help your new
ally however is not considered a violation.  

Hospitality: In order to successfully host meetings and settle disputes,
members of different organizations may often need to work together.  To
extend someone Venetian hospitality covers that individual until they leave
the residence or place of business in question.  Any harm that befalls them
there that you did not do your best to prevent is considered a violation.  

Whenever a violation occurs, reparations are determined.  The general
principle is that the aggrieved is paid back for the offense threefold.  If
they lost a hundred dollars, they must be paid back three hundred.  If they
lost a finger, the guilty will lose three fingers.  If they were killed, the
guilty and two members of his or her family will be put to death.  

Such matters are generally resolved by a council involving a representative
from each of the two involved organizations and a representative of one
other signatory organization, determined by random draw.  In most clear cut
cases however, the matter does not proceed this far and an organization
simple forces their member to par the threefold reparations.

Text While practitioners of magic are a very varied group, when they come
together there are some customs they all tend to follow.  

Due to the greater ease of stealing youth while somewhat physically old,
most arcanists tend to look in their forties or fifties.  

Arcanist or Practitioner are the most accepted terms for anybody who uses
magic, with Practitioner being preferred in non-supernaturally aware
society.  

Those who can use battle magic but not yet throw around pure force are
usually called Mancers, and battle magic of this type is generally referred
to as Mancing.  

Those who can throw around pure bolts of fire or lightning or similar forces
are called Sorcerers, and that type of magic sorcery.  

Most arcanists first spend time as an apprentice, working for their master
in exchange for tutelage.  In some organizations apprentices might be
apprenticed to a group instead of an individual.  In formal introductions
it's customary to give the name of your master, and often even their master
even if the arcanist is no longer an apprentice.  Such as: "I am Jane Smith,
student of John Smith, student of John Doe." , While an apprentice would
introduce themselves as "I am Jane Smith, apprentice of John Smith, student
of John Doe."  

Apprenticeships vary significantly in length, few are shorter than one year
or longer than ten.  Abuse of apprentices if a very common practice in many
magical circles, but rarely discussed.  It is not uncommon for them to be
taken advantage of sexually by their masters, to be beaten physically for
poor performance, to be sacrificed in rituals if they do not perform, to
have their life force fed upon, or their possessions and finances claimed by
their master.  This is obviously far less common in organizations like the
white circle, and far more common in organizations such as the black.  When
it is brought up it is generally swept under the rug as simply, the cost of
the privilege of learning magic.  

The circles and their members are often simply referred to by color, such as
"He is a red", or "I hear that happens in the black."  

If someone is called a witch it generally means they are either a member of
the coven, or were taught by them.  

A rogue is someone who belongs to no arcane group.  

A hedge mage/witch is someone who has been self taught and are generally
looked down upon.  

A magical duel is a fight in which neither participant may assault the other
except through magical means, and continues until either the participant is
no longer able to stand, or no longer able to keep fighting such as if they
have no sorcery and their minion has been dispelled.  Among mancers this
becomes in essence a test of minion against minion, with their mancing being
used to try and effect the outcome, among sorcerers however it usually
becomes much more a battle of energy vs energy.  It is almost impossible
under the rules of a standard magical duel for a mancer to defeat a
sorcerer.

It allows people to perform commands on you that can only be done on

Text An old man slides into the booth opposite you, an arthritic hand shaking
slightly as it neatly sets down a pair of simple sunglasses on the table in
front of him. He gazes at you with rheumy, unseeing eyes, a sardonic smile
crinkling his weathered features. He holds up one hand to forestall your
protest before it can be properly voiced. "No, no, I know. You ain't got
any cash on you," he says before his gnarled fingers entwine on the 
tabletop. "That ain't why I sat down." He shifts his weight to get more
comfortable before continuing. "See, I got a talent-- a talent for knowing
things,  you might say. You're off to Haven, ain't you? You got that energy
about you, all vibrant and eager; ready to make your mark on the world,
yeah? Before you head on off, though, maybe there's a piece of advice I
could part with. Help see you on your way." He allows a significant pause
before nodding to himself.
 
"The first thing you gotta understand about this world, kid, is the lie."
He starts before abruptly grilling you with, "Know how much sugar is in a
cheeseburger from Mickey Dee's?" A beat to let you answer is offered before
he does so for you. "Close to two teaspoons. Two teaspoons in a burger!
That seem right to you?" His head gives a slow, world-weary shake of pure
disappointment. "But see, that's all part of the lie. TV ain't no better.
You switch it on and what do you see? Sitcom, sitcom, sitcom, all making
the same jokes. 'Oh, what an awkward situation our whacky protagonists have
found themselves in now!'" His tone is mocking and his expression dour.
"Maybe you see some other show in between but never fear, the good guys
will always catch the villain... or it'll be some reality show. That's part 
of the lie too. You wanna know reality?"  He shifts a little closer, his
voice dropping to a conspiratorial rasp. "You see, the lie is all about
keeping humanity complacent-- keeping them full of sugar and laughter and
daydreams so they don't cause too much fuss, don't put up too much of a
fight, never peel back the skin of the world to see the writhing
infestation beneath. The truth is... in this world, there's only one rule:
everyone pays.
 
"You think your neighbour who won the lottery got lucky? Not at all, kid.
She made a deal with a Fae for that bit of luck. You think your president
got elected by being popular? Think again. He's got pacts and deals going
back decades." He sniffs loudly and gives a roll of his shoulders. 
"Politicians being corrupt don't surprise anybody too much, though. That
self-made business man on the other side of town, rich and prosperous and
living the American dream? He's in the pocket of criminals or demons-- or
both. Your sports hero? He probably ain't even human. If he is, he's made
deals or shoots himself up to compete. Maybe not with anything science can
detect, but something all the same. What about that movie star you used to
fantasize about when you were all by yourself in your room as a teenager?
You think they got famous through acting talent?" The cynical man snorts
derisively. "Kid, the Fae own Hollywood. The things they had to do for
their big break... not even a lifetime supply of cocaine is going to block
the memories of it, believe me. Getting things through hard work or talent?
That's just all part of the lie, kid. The truth is this. You want something
in the world, you gotta pay for it. You gotta pay with your humanity and
with your very soul." He emphasizes this point with a jab of one arthritic
finger towards your chest.  
 
"But I can tell I ain't deterred you. You got that fire in your eyes. Hell,
maybe I even turned you on a little-- got you a little excited. Maybe
you're happy to give up your humanity. Eager, even. Ready to stop being
stepped on and start doing the stepping, that it? If so, you might just fit
in real well, but I gotta warn you: lots of people tried to climb to the
top of that ladder before and ended up falling into the pit instead. It
ain't just the people above you kicking you in the head you gotta watch out
for; it's the people below you grabbing your ankles too." He sits back in
the booth, evidently satisfied with his diatribe. After a moment of
thought, though, he shifts in place and observes you closely. "Then again,
maybe that fire in your eyes means something else. Does it mean you think
you're gonna change things, stand up for what's right, be a hero? Since you
can't change anything without some kind of power, though, the question
becomes... how much of a monster are you going to become to fight the other
monsters? How long until you can't even tell the difference between you and
them? How long until there's another energetic young kid with fire in their
eyes painting a mental bullseye on your forehead and trying to take you out
to make the world a better place? If you're looking for someone else to
protect you, you're more naive than I can help. In this world, the only
person who's going to save you from a monster is a bigger, badder monster."
 
He stretches languidly, joints popping, before a tremulous hand reaches out
to reclaim his glasses. Sliding out of the booth, he snorts, "Well, I don't
want to keep you. You got that big destiny to fulfill and everything." A
wry chuckle is voiced as he turns for the door, but he stops at the last
moment and peers back in your direction. "Hmm. Let me make your choices
plain, kid, in case you ain't followed me real well so far. You pretty much
only got two of them, so it should be simple." He waits a moment before
continuing as if to be sure he has your attention. "You can bend over for
the monsters. Spread your cheeks, 'yes sir', 'no sir', 'whatever you say,
sir'-- all eager and compliant. Maybe you'll even learn to like it. Or...
you can struggle, fight, all that jazz. But let me tell you, kid. The
monsters? They love it when you struggle."

Text Description:
This is the description of the operation, it should generally be at least
three lines and explain the basic details of the operation, such as the
history, why people want to do whatever they want, who the adversaries will
be and so on.  

AdversaryName:
This is the string that the adversaries in the operation will appear by,
such as X shoots you.  X changes to coordinates.  

AdversaryType:
The type of adversary you'll face, current options are archaic and modern. 

AreaName:
The name of the room the operation will take place in.  

Territory:
The supernatural territory the operation will take place in or,
Other, Godrealm, Wilds in the case of offworld operations.

Type:
The type of operation, see help operation types.  

ItemName:
In operations that are targeted at a specific item this is what that item
will appear as, such as person has X, person gives X to other person.  E. 
G.  'the ancient tablets'

Capture Process Name:
In operations in which one or more locations much be captured this sets the
name of the process that must be completed, such as person continues X, or
you are 10 percent done with X.  E.  G.  'uploading the virus'

Goal:
The goal of the operation, see help operation goals.

Target:
An field required for some operational goals. See help operation goals.

Terrain:
Sets the type of terrain you will be fighting over, options are: Forest,
Field, Town, City, Desert, Mountains, Warehouse.

MaximumCharacters:
Sets the maximum number of PCs from any alliance that can go on the operation
with a value of between 2 and 8. Non supernaturals count for 2/3ds of a
supernatural.  So 3 non supernaturals could go on an operation with a
maximum size of 2.  The number of NPC soldiers you can deploy to any given
operation will be twice this number.  

Competition:
Set to Open/Restricted/Closed. Open is the default type of operation.
Restricted operations only give half the resources to the winner but no other
alliance can send a PC force considered more powerful overall than the one sent
by the creating alliance. This makes it a good choice for operations made by or
designed for newer characters or non-combat characters.
Closed operations cannot be seen by or attended by anyone outside of the creating
society but also reward no resources. They can be set with 0 in the day field however.
They are well suited to practice or within society group activities.

Challenge:
Allows characters to make the rewards of winning an operation higher by making
the NPC adversaries more numerous. 0 is the default and is generally recommended.
NPC adversaries base number is determined by the overall power of the most powerful
attending alliance.

Priority:
This allows you to list players which will be taken over others if more than max
is present, you can include yourself on this list and should leave a space between
the names of every character on it.

Speed:
Sets the speed of the battle, speed 1 is the same speed as the game uses by
default when engaged in combat in the forest against mobs.  Speed 2 is twice
as slow, speed 3 is three times as slow and so on.  Maximum speed is 6 which
makes each combat round a minute and a half long.  

Hour:
The hour of the day in Haven time you want the operation to occur.  

Day:
The number of days from now the operation will occur.  This counts down
every time the designated hour passes.  So if the current time is 10 and you
set hour to 11 and day to 1 it will occur tomorrow at 11.  But if you set
hour to 9 and day to 1 it will occur the day after tomorrow at 9.  
 
Storyline:
An optional field which will make the operation part of a storyline and involve
all participants in that storyline.
 
Storyrunner:

Text Psychic Battles form the backbone of how societies manipulate the mundane
world. They involve using machines which link together the psyches of a large
number of people in a targeted locale. This creates a sort of shared psychic
plane that all those inviduals share.

Operatives of the society then project themselves into this psychic plane or
order to make changes. Whatever they change in this world will change the
minds of those who are part of it. If they break down a door in the psychic
plane, security guards in the physical plane will leave it unlocked, or
builders will forget to build it properly all while being entirely unaware
that they're doing anything unusual.

While the effects of these actions can sometimes be unpredicable, they are
constant enough to make them well worthwhile. They are unfortunately also
highly predictable, with other societies easily being able to read the
increasing psychic energy when one is attempted, and being able to
send operatives of their own to thwart the attempts of others or ideally
to take advantage of them for themselves.

The subconcious minds of those who make up the planes also usually attempt
to defend themselves against this intrusion, with soldiers or guards of
some sort typically manifesting in the psychic plane to repel the intruders.
These also usually grow in strength the longer the attempted infiltration.

Only the mind of operatives attending these battles roams, their body
simply falls asleep. Although this does render them rather vulnerable
to enemies who may be waiting for just such an opportunity. The abilities
of operatives in the psychic plane always seem to perfectly mirror their
real world abilities, despite many attempts by the societies to date to
try and trick operatives in order to believe they are far superior to
reality in the hope it will manifest as improved skills in the psychic
plane.

Text Intercept:

All participating socities will arrive on the battlefield as well as a group
of adversaries.  One of the adversaries will be holding the targeted item. 
Every alliance has an extraction point which is the same point they spawned
in on.  A timer will count down and when it's done, if any team gets the
targeted item and gets back to their extraction point they win.  

To obtain the item you must kill the NPC with it, at that point it will go
to their killer if they're close by, or otherwise the closest elligble PC or
NPC.  Being the carrier reduces your base speed to 10 + your stamina stat. 
Shifted PCs cannot carry the item, not can people carry it flying.  You can
use the handoff command to target another character to give the item to if
you end up carrying it.  

The adversaries will be reinforced regularly with more soldiers.  Should all
PCs on the field be defeated, the adversaries win.  Characters can move
towards their extraction point with move extraction, but this argument won't
work for charging or jumping.  

Extraction:

Extraction works similarly to intercept except one of the members of the
alliance who designed the operation starts with the item of value and there
is only one extraction point for everyone, set somewhere randomly upon the
battlefield.  As in intercept teams must wait until the timer expires and
then have the item on the extraction point.  

Capture:

All participating alliances will arrive on the battlefield as well as a group
of adversaries.  There will also be a capture location placed somewhere upon
the battlefield at random.  If a character gets to that point they can then
use the command capture, or attack capture to progress their teams control. 
This uses their attack for one round and puts that point onto cooldown for
one round so nobody else can use the command.  Once one team has progressed
far enough they will win the operation.  

The adversaries will be reinforced regularly with more soldiers.  Should all
PCs on the field be defeated, the adversaries win.  Characters can move
towards the capture point with move capture, but this argument won't work
for charging or jumping.  

Multiple Capture:

This works similarly to Capture except there are three capture locations,
each with independent cooldowns.  So alliances can obviously win much faster
if they control all three, or at least two out of the three.  Move capture
will move you towards your closest capture location.

Operations are combat missions planned and executed by societies.  Anyone in
a society can create an operation, although they might be canceled by more
senior members in player made societies. When doing so they specify all the details
of that mission such as where it will take place, when it will occur the
goals to be achieved and the adversaries to face.

If a societies suceeds at an operation they are rewarded with resources, more
resources are given if more enemies show up.  If the society which created
the operation wins they will earn 10% more if the operation was created by
their leader.

Help Operation Fields outlines all the fields you can fill in when making an
operation and what they mean.  

Help Operation Types explains the different objectives that operations can
have.  

Help Psychic Battles explains the lore behind operations.  
 
The authors of operations can sometimes earn small amounts of karma when
their operation launches, so long as they're online.
 
Winners of operations earn resources based on the number of participants and
challenge of the operation, others can earn resources based on number of NPC
adversaries defeated.
 
All other societies have to do to participate in operations is sign up with
the operation signup command. Characters can participate from anywhere but
will be vulnerable and asleep while participating.
 
The rewards for winning an operation are lower the more you have already won
in that week. They are also lower if you fight less enemies, always run them
at the same time, or always face the same opponents, particularly if you tend
to get similar results against the same opponents.
 
`WOperation reinforce (operation number) (number of soldiers)`w can be used to
send soldiers (noted as 'manpower' in `Wsociety info`w) to assist in operations.
These soldiers can be guided with the `Wbattle`w command.
 
`WOperation timeshift (operation number) (positive or negative hours)`x can be
used by the target of a psychic operation to change when it will occur.
 
`WOperation signup (operation number)`x is used to sign up to operations.
 
`WOperation bribe (operation number)`x is used to win an operation without
fighting it for a base cost of 50k resources.
 
`WTerritory lockout (number of days) (territory)`x Prevents operations being
created in that territory for the specified number of days. Costs $200 resources for one day, increasing
by 150% for each following day, so $300 for 2 days, $450 for 3, $675 for 4.
 
 
Nightmare pull, dream invade and dream snare now all work on enemies in
operations. Using any of these commands will make the command considered
pending, and you must be the one to defeat the enemy to make it fire. 
Doing so will immediately remove you from the operation. 
 
Nightmare pull will pull the target through the nightmare to your current
location, they will be unconscious when they arrive and considered
abducted codely and thus of no real alchemical value. 
 
Normal lifeforce costs apply and none of these actions can be performed on
someone with a weakness.

This command allows people to low their damage when fighting PCs to the
selected percentage.  Using dimish 50 for instance will make you do half
damage.  It has no echo to others, diminish 0 or diminish 100 will clear it
as will logging off for a while.  Using the command by itself shows what
you're currently set at.  

This allows players to represent their characters being weaker for any RP
reason, or pulling their punches/faking weakness.  

An alternate syntax allows you to offer someone a diminishment pact, with
diminish offer (person) (number) If someone accepts this you will both be
set to be diminished to the preset amount.  You can diminish yourself
further if you wish, but if you try and set your diminish higher it will
cancel the pact for both people.  This will also be automatically canceled
if the two people aren't in the same room.  It is useful for people who want
to engage in a coded fight, but also want to draw it out.  
 
Using diminish round (number) will diminish only your next source of
damage and will also echo to the room that you've done so. It is useful
for people who want to RP some IC event causing a temporary weakness
in their fighting.
 
Using diminish longterm will allow you to debuff your character for several hours, or
even days or weeks. This will always echo to the room you are in and if done with the
visible toggle will also show in your look info, if done with invisible won't be seen,
and if combatvisible will appear to others when you enter a fight.

Encounters are random IC events run by storyrunners that occur in an
instanced version of Haven.  

SRs first use encounter launch, this command will find a player and pick
from a list of 50+ possible encounters, prompting the player with the option
to join an encounter and giving the name of the SR running it.  The player
has two minutes to respond, if they accept both they and the SR are moved
into an instanced copy of the room they were just in, and the SR is given a
short one to two sentence description of the encounter.  

The SR will then use this writing prompt to create a small RP scene for the
participants, they will earn enhanced karma for this much like they would
for running an adventure, but not as much.  During the adventure they can of
course summon in new people if there's a reason to single them out in
particular, but they can also make use of the encounter bringin command.  

This command puts the encounter onto the where list with the string the SR
specifies, appearing as (string) is happening in (room) and also the name of
the SR and person first recruited.  It also sends an echo to those most
likely to notice the encounter going on.  From there players can use
encounter join (SR name) to join the encounter up to a maximum of five.  

SRs can edit encounter rooms with the decorate command. 
 
There is a `Wweek cooldown`w on running encounters.
 
Every 6 weeks an SR can use encounter launch (name) to launch an encounter with a particular target.

Once the SR sees the encounter they can add it to an existing storyline if they think it fits.

Once added to a storyline they can also assign it a mastermind if it makes sense.
 
Be advised that encounters are not private affairs; they show up on `Wsociety view`x for society members.

everyone in the room for about fifteen minutes.  

The out of combat effect will not carry over if a fight breaks out.  

Individuals can also be neutralized by wearing a neutralization collar or
being implanted with a neutralizer.  

When neutralized a supernatural loses access to all their supernatural
abilities.  Although they haven't actually been changed and vampires
continue to be undead and so on, they're unable to access any supernatural
powers or abilities for the duration.  All supernatural powers and abilities
are rendered zero except for mimic and obfuscate, physical stats are also
lowered as is maximum damage from melee and shapeshifter attacks.  But
things like supernatural durability or toughness are not.  Abomination
powers are not neutralized but abominations cannot go blackeyes while they
are if not already.  

Shapeshifters who are neutralized in animal form become typical members of
their animal species, not only losing a good deal of their combat power but
also losing their human memories, thoughts and higher cognitive powers
entirely for the duration.

Text `WSyntax:`x Naturalize target

This command fires a naturalizer at the specified target.  It requires a
naturalizer which looks like a black polymer electronic handgun.  

In combat it can only be used by those with 5 points in the soldiering
ability line and has a 50 unit range.  

Out of combat it can be used by anyone, but if the target is not helpless or
bound the chance of a hit is quite low.  

When fired the gun emits a faint whine noise, but otherwise there's no
obvious sign of it having been fired.  

If a shifter in animal form is struck but the naturalizer they will be
turned back into their human shape, and be unable to shift back into animal
form for some time.  Animals who have been neutralized cannot be
naturalized.

Text Also often referred to as the conflict, or the struggle the supernatural
cold war is the battle that goes on between disparate supernaturals and
supernatural groups for dominance.

As this is a cold war open fatal conflict is very rarely involved with most
of the struggle conducted in battles of influence and backroom dealings over
control.  Opportunistic violence does occur however, and if a society member
found themselves in an isolated area without witnesses encountering members
of other societies they're likely to be roughed up or robbed.  In contested
territories such as Haven opportunistic violence is even more common, and
even sought out as participants in the cold war use roughing up, harvesting,
temporary detainment, humiliations or other measures to assert their
dominance to the supernatural community at large or disrupt the operations
of their opponents.  Higher levels of violence that involve permanent injury
or death only occurs in those territories which break out into a full war
state, if they occurred anywhere else and the perpetrator wasn't brought to
swift justice that territory would likely devolve into a war state until the
issue was resolved.  Even in territories in war lethal violence is rare,
both owing to people being wary of crossing that line lest they end up on
the wrong side of it later on, and the responsibility to keep the conflict


While successfully carrying out harassment against other participants of the
supernatural cold war might bring you acclaim from your fellows, harassing
or assaulting people who are acknowledge non participants tends to only
generate a negative reputation for bullying.  

Lore wise Haven is considered a territory constantly in a contested state. 
With the understanding effectively preventing escalation into a war state
unless it can be successfully lowered.

The attractiveness stat makes the largest difference and allows players
to indicate if they want their character to be attractive, unattractive
or average.

There are three other aspects that go into attractiveness:

`cBody`g:`x Determined primarily by the physical conditioning stat.
Provides enhanced benefit if you are wearing less clothing than you
typically do.

`cPresentation`g:`x Determined primarily by the fashion knowledge stat.
Provides enhanced benefit if you are wearing an outfit that is more
expensive than you typically do.

`cFace/Skin`g:`x Determined primarily by the beauty rituals stat.
Provides enhanced benefit if it has been less time since your most
recent shower than typical and/or you are wearing more makeup than
is typical.

You can use the '`ccheckout`x' command to look at the breakdown of a
character's appearance.

Being higher tier will also add an additional boost for each tier
above 1. And small boosts can also be obtained from perfume, shapewear,
ambient light levels, and character affects like orientation, vehicle
buffs, praise etc.

Attractivess works exactly the same for men and women.

Text `WSyntax:`x Make Petition

Petitions allow players to communicate issues to staff, they are the only
way to do so that is guaranteed to be seen.  

To create a petition simply type make petition and then fill in the fields,
possible types are bug, suggestion and request.  The to field can be left
blank, and should be used if there's one staff member in particular you need
to look at your petition, this is particularly useful if you need Daed or
Discordance to look at a petition.  

Description puts you in an editor to write your petition and when you're
done typing done will complete and send it.  Petitions will last forever
until a staffer sets them as resolved or dismissed, and then will last for a
further 5 or so days after that.  

`WNote:`x Staff often gets a hundred or more petitions a week, of these most
will be dismissed.  For instance 90% of bug reports are not actually bugs,
but just someone misunderstanding/misusing code or plain not liking
something.  Because of the very high noise to signal ratio it's inevitable
that some legitimate petitions will be overlooked, and we apologize in
advance for these situations.  

`WNote on Bugs:`x Most bug reports, even for real bugs are generally written in
a fairly bad way.  If you'd like your issue to have a high chance of being
investigated and fixed you need to be clear and concise, give all character
names where relevant and report the bug in a way that's reproducible.  It's
very common for someone to report a bug as simply X doesn't work, then a
staffer tries it and it works fine and the issue is dismissed.  Even though
there may well be a bug, but it's that it only occurs in certain
circumstances which they weren't informed of.  With enough time staff can
fix essentially any bug as long as it's reliably reproducible.  

Renovate petition types are applications to be given ownership of a property
and a special flag allowing for free decoration up until the first rental
payment, which will also be free.  These are granted when someone makes a
solid argument for wanting to change an existing property into something
more in theme or appropriate to the setting and should include the problems
with the existing property as well as the proposed changes.

Text Society members have a standing and a rank.  Standing is automatic and is
generated by praises/disses as well as some automated activity like RPing
while wearing asociety symbol.  Standing determines roster order and who'll
take over the society if the leader dies, steps down, or quits.  

Rank is set by the leaders, and conveys the trusts the member has when not
suspended.  Each rank has a custom name and trusts.  But is separate from
paygrade.  

Rank trusts are set with the society ranktrust (rankname) (trust) command. 
The different trusts are: 
 
Comms - gives access to ssay alliance comms.
News - gives access to society news and announce.
Resource - Allow this rank to use society resources.
Brainwash - Allow this rank to use society resources for brainwashing.
Suspensions - Allow this rank to hand out suspensions.
Promotions - Allow this rank to promote people.
Recruitment - Allow this rank to recruit people.
Banishing - Allow this rank to kick people out.
Commanding - Allow this rank to order NPC soldiers.

Text Brainwashing can only be done in a `Wbrainwashing facility`w. A target must be
helpless and without Sanctuary protection in order for brainwashing to proceed. The 
brainwashing cooldown lasts one month. One brainwashing procedure can only be done at
a time.
 
Brainwashing reversals have a slim chance to happen automatically once a day for all
characters who maintain life force at or near 100%. These types of reversals do
not affect implants.

Brainwash types neutralizer and implant require medicine 4 to perform.
 
`cSyntax`g: `Wbrainwash implant `g(`Wtarget`g)`w
  This command installs a remote-controlled device in the target's head, producing
  a controller and causing a severe injury.
`cSyntax`g: `Wcontrol incapacitate`w 
  When in possession of a controller, this command renders your implanted target
  unconscious.
`cSyntax`g: `Wtrash controller`w
  Destroy a controller, rendering an implant inert.
  
`cSyntax`g: `Wbrainwash neutralizer `g(`Wtarget`g)`w
  This command installs a neutralizer device inside a target, nullifying all 
  supernatural abilities. Implanting this device causes a severe injury.
`cSyntax`g: `Wbrainwash extraction `g(`Wtarget`g)`w
  This command can be used to try to remove a neutralizing implant. Removal attempts
  can only be attempted on healthy targets and cause severe injury. Chance of success
  for removal is very low, and it is typical for this procedure to take several attempts
  before it is successful. The engineering and medicine stats improve chance of success.
 
`cSyntax`g: `Wbrainwash loyalty `g(`Wtarget`g) (`Wperson or society name`g)`w
  This brainwashes a target to be loyal to the specified party. The target will
  receive regular imprints about needing to be loyal to said party.

`cSyntax`g: `Wcontrol surrender `g(`Wtarget`g)`w
  The person or leader of the faction a target is loyal to can use this command to force
  the target to tie themselves up.
 
`cSyntax`g: `Wbrainwash pacifist `g(`Wtarget`g)`w
  This brainwashes a target against violence. The rationalization is their own, but they
  cannot attack anyone codedly while under this type of brainwashing.
 
`cSyntax`g: `Wbrainwash cleanse `g(`Wtarget`g)`w
  This removes all the bad memories from the target party, whether they were the victim
  or perpetrator of such events. It also removes the memory of any desire to commit
  bad or evil deeds. They are otherwise left unaffected, but this type of brainwashing
  may be enough to redeem a previously bad person.
 
`cSyntax`g: `Wbrainwash reidentity `g(`Wtarget`g) (`Wnew identity`g)`w
  This causes a target to believe they are the identity specified. Detail about these
  identities should be specified in emotes or messages if needed.

`cSyntax`g: `Wbrainwash reversal `g(`Wtarget`g)`w
  This type of procedure reverses all non-implant brainwashing procedures, restoring
  a character to their original mindset. It also reverses memory suppression and
  false memories derived from alchemically created potions. This does not remove
  explosive or neutralizer implants. Nor does it remove imprints.

Text `WSyntax`x: Harvest (person)

This command has to be done on a helpless target and in the medical rooms
in the basement of the Clinic.  It harvests life force from the target to 
store in a small metal cylinder.  The target is left weaker for some time 
afterwards.  The process involves drawing of blood and electrical energy 
through tubes and wires and produces an energized liquid like substance 
which can be sold for significant amounts of society resources.  The 
higher tier the character the more valuable the extracted material.  The 
process takes about 30 minutes assuming the person doing the harvesting 
in actively RPing.  Characters who have been abducted are worth 
significantly less, as are new characters.  
 
Once the process is complete the cylinder can be turned into resources with

This stat conveys the ability for people to have access to some of the
powers and strengths of their animal form while in human shape. 
Metashifters are also often mildly physically influenced and moderately
psychologically influenced by their primary animal form.  While this won't
extend to developing non human physical characteristics it may mean their
hair color matches the fur color of their animal form, or that it grows
faster or hardier.  It's also likely to affect the way they move or carry
themselves.  Psychologically they're likely to adapt similar patterns to
their animal form when it comes to base instincts like aggression, diet or
sex.  Carniviorous metashifters may develop a taste for heavily meat based
diets and rawer meats, they'd also prone to violence and stalking. 
Metashifters whose animal forms have mating cycles will find themselves
influenced by those same cycles and so on.  It's very common for predatory
metashifters to have a history of violent crime.  

This skill grants: Your animal's acrobatics skill, their acute senses, their
nightvision, half their running, half their strength/power, half their
dexterity, half their ranged defense, half their perception, half their
stealth, half their power as melee specialization.  

`cNote`g:`x Meta shifting's benefits will only draw from your primary form.  This

Text Supernatural development usually begins right as puberty starts to end. 
The most typical age for this in males is 18, 16 for females.  Development
takes on average three years.  

Supernatural development generally begins quite subtly, with mild increases
in health and physical performance, those around the developing supernatural
might notice that they generally seem to have more energy than normal, and
begin to perform better in sports.  

The development takes it's toll however, only a few months in most would be
supernaturals start to exhibit mental symptoms.  Mild to severe psychiatric
disorders, as well as irresponsibility, poor judgment, recklessness are all
common side effects.  While mental disease is no more common in adult
supernatural than adult naturals, a full 75% of them will have a past
history of mental disease or crime.  Short prison stints or periods in
asylums are relatively common.  

About mid way through the process actual supernatural abilities and talents
will begin to develop, usually starting off very uncontrollable and of
extremely mild power but slowly increasing in strength.  It's also common at
this time for characters to begin to have dreams related to their ancestry. 

As the process comes to a close, the mental effects fade away, the dreams
become much less common and the individual's abilities both grow stronger
and come more completely under their control.  As far as the world is
concerned the individual has successfully managed to 'turn their life
around.  '

There are two ways for supernatural development to be blocked.  The first is
insanity, characters who're highly mentally unstable will be stuck in stage
where their powers are weak and uncontrollable, they also are often stuck
with the ancestry dreams as well, which can make them useful research
subjects for trying to glean more information about the past of
supernaturals.  This also means that despite their likely troubled past,
serious mental disorders of the mundane type are all but unheard of amongst
active supernaturals.  

The second is complete closed-mindedness to the possibility of the
supernatural.  This has to go far beyond normal scientific skepticism.  It
can occur when treatment for their mental illness is particularly severe and
effective, or when someone has been raised into a strong belief that
contradicts the existence of the supernatural.  Occasionally people with
particularly distressing powers or who've used them in particularly
distressing ways will create a subconscious block themselves preventing
their belief. Societies also occasionally brainwash people into this belief
in order to lock their abilities away.  

Mature development also occurs but is much rarer in the world at large. 
Only 5% of supernaturals will develop late, but there's no particular time
when it will occur if they do.  It's much more common than this in Haven
however because of the proximity to the gate.  It also occurs if someone has
a block that occurred before or during supernatural development that then
breaks in later life.  Mature development is much faster, usually taking
place over only a few weeks.  However it is also more dangerous, if the
individual develops psychological or behavioral problems they're likely to
be much more severe, causing people to become raging psychotics or malicious
psychopaths for short periods of time before the effects fade.  

Many people attempt to become supernatural, fortunately a good portion of
the world's population has some fragment of a supernatural gene within them,
and thus have a chance of manifesting it if they try.  When successful these
attempts produce something very similar to mature development, although the
psychological and behavioral side effects are usually less common, only
affecting about 25% of deliberately manifested people.  

`cMethods`W:`x

`WAlchemy`c)`x Experimentation with potions comprised of mixtures of mundane and
supernatural ingredients can be effective at triggering a manifestation. 
Although the exact same potion will never work on two different people.  

`WGene Therapy`c)`x Modern science also has a solution, genetic therapies based on
the genes of manifested supernaturals can be effective at triggering
manifestation, although again each treatment is unique to the patient.  

`WMeditation`c)`x Some people are able to trigger manifestation after prolonged
periods of mastering monk like meditation practices.  

`WRitualism`c)`x Experimentations with mystical rituals directed at the target can
be effective at inducing manifestation, although again the exact ritual will
be unique to the individual, it also tends to go through a lot of blood
before the right one is found.  

`WTrauma`c)`x Sometimes manifestation is brought on by serious physical or mental
trauma, in some cases this may be used to attempt to induce manifestation. 
Sometimes in very primitive ways such as torture, other times in more
clinical ways such as anesthetized electroshock therapy.

`WSyntax:`x Runinto (pedestrian)

-This command attempts to run down someone standing/walking on the road.  It
is only usable after you've reached 100 hours.  You can target anybody
visible up to four rooms ahead of your vehicle.  Motorcycles cannot do this.
Damage is increased the faster your car is, supernaturals, abominations and
the undead are less affected.  The victim may be unaffected, or mildly to
critically wounded.  If you severely or critically wound someone who is
protected you will be tainted.  There's a chance to temporarily knock out
individuals mildly or severely wounded.  There's a chance to have an
accident afterwards.  If the streets are public, a news item will go up
announcing your hit and run.  

`WSyntax:`x runinto (vehicle)

-This command attempts to ram your car into another car on the street, it
can be targeted at any vehicle visible up to four rooms ahead of your
vehicle.  Motorcycles cannot do this and tend to fare poorly when targeted
by it.  Each car is given a rating based on speed and toughness, going
faster and being tougher means you're more likely to come out of the
accident on top.  Both cars are at least damaged and characters thrown out
of them, they may also receive mild or severe wounds depending on who came
out on top in the accident, and the safety rating of the vehicle.  Currently
this cannot cause understanding violations.  

`WSyntax:`x attack (vehicle)

-This allows a person not in a car to attempt to force an accident by
attacking a vehicle.  It can only be done when the area isn't public,
generally meaning it must be wreathed in mist.  If your character has some
type of firearm this is what will be used, the change the vehicle is stopped
is based on your disciplines with firearms versus the toughness of the car. 
Excellent quality tough cars can never be driven off the road with firearms.


If you don't have a firearm but have access to hellfire, shadow lightning or
a custom attack you will attempt to use this instead.  The chance again
depends on the toughness of the vehicle but it is general more likely to
work than firearms.  If you have brute force or a strength of greater than 8
you can also attempt to use that, but the vehicle must be in the room with
you.  Attempting to attack a vehicle with close range powers, or long range
powers once it's in the same room as you incurs a chance to get run over if
you're unsuccessful.  

If successful the car will be forced into an accident, and the passengers
may end up slightly injured.

Text `WIn General`x: Storyideas must at least not directly contradict any of the game's
lore. Storyideas should have some fairly clear outline of what is going to
happen and what their scope is. They should try to fit within the general theme
of paranormal horror.

`WAdventures/Quests`x: Adventures must take place outside of Haven and not impact
the grid or the players on the grid. They must be entirely opt-in, meaning that
players should never feel obligated to go on an adventure even if they
don't want to. The characters should have a reasonable understanding of
the potential risks of going on any given adventure.

`WOther/Personal`x: On grid plots will generally only be approved if they're
very low key and don't have a lot of supernatural elements. They'll also likely
not be approved if they involve a lot of heavy antagonism or there seems a
reasonable chance that other people will be sucked into the story despite their
OOC interests.

`WBackgrounds`x: Ideas that involve someone's background will only be approved if
there's nothing questionable about that background. Which generally means it
must be a pretty straight forward background, any elements of victimization
in the background or aggrandization or claims to special status or events are
likely to be grounds for having the idea turned down. Such backgrounds need
to support themselves based on the RP of the character and won't be given
any staff stamp of approval through an associated approved plot.

`WVictimization`x: Ideas that involve significant victimization or directed
antagonism are unlikely to be approved.

`WAggrandizement`x: Ideas that involve significant aggrandizement of the participants
are unlikely to be approved. That might mean that when they succeed some great
event occurs or that they're chosen for the mission because of being super
special.

`WTips`x:

`c*`xVery few Fae messing with people ideas get approved. Ideas that involved the
big three antagonists directly are treated carefully to begin with but most Fae
based plots are often either too silly or too heavily about victimization to be
approved.

`c*`xIdeas that seem to be sold by their importance, or impact instead of the
actual story usually get turned down. As a general tip you should try to
get people interested in your adventures by the quality of your storytelling
and writing, not by offering bigger rewards or more impactful events or
anything similar to your players than other SRs.

`c*`xGods/Fae/Demons really care nothing about their human descendants. Ideas
based on my godly ancestor comes down to tell me I'm awesome etc are
unlikely to be approved.

`c*`xIdeas that would cause the secrecy of the supernatural world to be
compromised are unlikely to be approved.

`c*`xIdeas using existing lore, subfactions and territories are more likely
to be approved than those who make up new ones.

`c*`xIn general the smaller the scale, the more human the antagonists and
the more morally complex, gritty, dirty and real the concept the more
likely it is to be approved.

Text `WAdventure`x - Adventures take place out of Haven entirely and are always
opt-in.  Players and characters make a choice to go along or not and then
apply, SRs take those that apply off grid and run the adventure before
returning them.  SRs receive Karma bonuses for these plots, and can
pass/fail players and give out awards at the end.  SRs are given advanced
trust over everyone going on an adventure with them.  

Joint/Competetive - Other types of adventure, either with different groups
working together, or different groups working against each other.  

`WQuest`x - A personalized adventure, this might be an adventure for just one
person or for a small group of people but the people who are going on it are
preselected ahead of time.  The Karma rewards for SRs are lower than that of
open adventures, but the players can still be passed/failed and earn
rewards.  

`WOther`x - Any other type of plot, usually something that takes place partly or
wholly in Haven.  Other plots are much rarer than adventures and usually
much more low key/non supernatural. They generate karma at an ambiance rate  

`WPersonal`w - A type of other plot targeted at a particular player or group of
players.  Also takes place partly or wholly in Haven, and tend to be very
lowknife key/non supernatural. Personal plots generate karma at the ambiance
rate and gain `Wno extra karma`w on completion.

`WMystery`w - A type of plot based on investigation.  SRs who are running
mysteries can gain karma from creating research and writing IC notes.  They
also can create hidden room descriptions.  Mysteries can take place in
Haven, but don't involve violence or action.  They conclusion may involve
those things but if so it has to occur either out of Haven or in the outer

Text Wights are a type of undead created by attempts to bring spirits back
into the world of the corporeal.  Wights are a type of undead, their heart
does not beat and they have no need of normal food or drink, but otherwise
they seem almost completely human.  They can even eat and drink if they'd
like without the problems vampires tend to have.  

However their bodies need to be sustained with living human flesh,
mechanically this means that wights need to use the bite command on helpless
PCs fairly regularly, inflicting one level of wound, none to mild, mild to
severe etc.  Those with regenerative powers offer significantly less
sustenance.  

If Wights don't feed often enough they will start to grow more corpselike,
with some of extremities beginning to show signs of rotting and the rot
slowly working it's way in before finally make it's way up to the face. 
Shortly afterwards if the wight continues to slip they will die, a wight
that dies cannot return as a ghost.  

Surviving as a wight is quite difficult, but still is the only shot at a
second chance at life most people are going to get.

For applicable syntax, each use of the command will move the target up or
down one increment. For height this is `Winches`w, and for age, this is one `Wyear`w per use.

Text The hire command can be used to pay for private investigations with money.
 This command works very similarly to the `Worder`w command, but hired
 investigators do not have a cooldown and do not have any requirements 
 outside of the cash in hand.
 
 The character being researched does not need to be targeted by coded name.
 Remembered names or short descriptions will work as well, regardless if
 it is a mask, although inexact keywords may return an unintended target. 
 If the target changes their appearance by shifting or masking, the command
 will return, "Cannot be found." Characters who are not online or not
 targetable will return a blank line.

 An investigation returns the target's basic information, such as their
 full name, date of birth, address and phone number. The report also
 may include any society and subfaction associations, owned properties, 
 and registered vehicle license plate numbers. 
 
 Once the results of an investigation has been returned to you, it is not

  have toggled their where visibility.
 
`cSyntax`g: `Wwherevis`x
  Wherevis toggles the where visibility and where anonymity of an individual
  when used in conjunction with a roomtitle.  A character must also have a
  roomtitle set in order to be visible on the where list.  If used a second
  time after it's already enabled, it will toggle anonymity.  A third time will
  disable both.

  This behaves as a toggle.  Where banning a target which is already on your
  list will allow that account to see your character again.
 
`cSyntax`g: `Whotspot`x
  This command will create a temporary hotspot at the character's location.
  Characters present in such a room will be totaled for and displayed with the
  where command.
 
The `Wwhere`x command is a fundamentally OOC tool that players can utilize to find
roleplaying partners more easily.  The output has two components: hotspots and
roomtitles.
 
Hotspots are locations where players would normally expect to encounter other
characters such as at the Lodge or other resturant.  These locations will not
display individual information about the characters present, but will total the
number of players present.  Shop owners can toggle the hotspot status of any
room they control with decorate hotspot.  Furthermore, any room that contains 
eight or more players will automatically become a hotspot.
 
The roomtitles of characters can also be displayed with the `Wwhere`x command, but
the players must opt in and have no more than two characters in the room to do
so.  This allows for individuals or pairs looking for roleplay to advertise
their activity in a particular room.  In order to toggle visibility, use the
`Wwherevis`x command and have a `Wroomtitle`x set.  Where visibility is turned off when
a character moves.  If an individual wishes to be visible on the where list, but
doesn't wish to advertise their intro, they may type `Wwherevis`x a second time and
it will change to either a man, a woman, or an animal as appropriate.
 
In situations where access to a location is limited such as within a character's home,
only those individuals with legitimate access will be able to see hotspots and other
where output relevant to those rooms.

world, generally beyond the ken of most normal society members to deal with.


`WSupernatural Deals`x

`WDemons`x:

You will never come out of a deal with a demon with the world being a better
place, you may end up ahead personally however.  Demons are all about
maximizing suffering, and will generally stick to deals as long as that
happens, they will break their word the second they are robbed of that
opportunity however and have no tolerance for word games.  They also tend to
hate people who aren't afraid of them.  

`WFae`x:

Fae love to play word games, and usually are looking to trick people trying
to make deals with them to suffer some awful fate.  They love rules
lawyering, but are very good sports when beaten, since they care less about
winning or losing than they do the game.  

`WGods`x:

Gods generally care more about the spirit of the deal than the letter of it,
and consider it binding.  Attempts to cheat them are usually met with
horrible wrath although they won't go back on their word, it'll just be of
less use to you once you're dead.  

`WCombat`x

Fae will almost never join a fight personally, and will simply run away once
their soldiers and monsters have been defeated.  Demons sometimes run away
and sometimes fight, and can even fight to the death sometimes although
players would rarely if ever be in a position to actually fight a demon
given they're all sealed away in hell.  Gods will usually fight for a while,
but after they get hit enough will decide they don't like it much anymore
and fuck the hell off.  

`WLieutenants`x

Demons typically operate through vassals, humans or abominations who've
gained power through a Faustian deal and are now beholden to the demon. 
Abominations working for demons can often be even stronger than typical
abominations, and would require large groups to eliminate in a direct fight.
Vassals want what their master wants, usually to an unhealthy degree, the
level of suffering inflicted upon them if they fail is pretty insane, they
will lie, cheat and steal if necessary to obtain it, its not uncommon to see
a Vassal put themselves through incredible suffering just to make sure they
succeed.  

Fae usually work through humans or monsters of their own creation, these are
often very strong but are more designed to evade direct conflicts in most
situations.  They are not particularly loyal to their masters as much as
they are expressing their natures.  The Fae made them to cause mischief and
so they will, but not necessarily in the way the Fae intended.  Humans
lieutenants are usually more straightforward and are simply doing it for
money or power, or fun or sex, the consequences of their failure are usually
less dire than that of demons, although depending on the Fae can still be
pretty fucked up.  

Gods work through angels, angels are 100% loyal and are really simply an
expression of the god's will although they may be quite intelligent and
powerful of their own accord, wingless ones are usually preferred for work
on earth.  Angels think nothing of sacrificing themselves for their cause. 


Lieutenants rarely operate alone and with their group they're typically more
than a match for a small group or even society, taking them out requires a
coordinated attack by several societies, which is fairly well and
strategically implemented.  These plans will usually go horribly wrong if
someone tips the bad guys off about them.  

`WAgents`x

Demonic agents are people who they've made deals with demons but not granted
particularly remarkable power, or those demons have fleshformed or had their
lieutenants manipulate.  They love to work with corrupt police officers in
particular, and often will jack them up physically slightly although the
officers are unaware of it.  They also enjoy corrupting people and using
their influence to force their employees to do work for them.  They consider
agents utterly disposable and generally employ them for singular tasks or to
support a lieutenant.  

Fae agents are people or creatures they've manipulated or fleshformed
somehow, or very often a luck manipulated figure.  They might turn a person
into some sort of monster, just to watch what happens, or give them the
craving for the flesh of a particular person they dislike, but rarely stoop
to giving them actual instructions.  Otherwise they'll use their ability to
make luck direct someone down a certain path, over the course of a year or
two they can quite comfortably take a man from a wealthy and influential
position to a homeless wreck obsessed with revenge.  They don't care about
the lives of their agents exactly, but do care that they go out in an
interesting way and last to get there.  

Godly agents are usually people who the gods have visited in some sort of
vision, while they often appear as their pantheonic identities, other times
they'll take on the guise of an angel or Jesus or whatever suits that
person's particular religious beliefs.  They then typically charge their
agent with some quest, some gods are very protective of their agents, while
others don't remotely care.  Depending on the strength of an agent they can
usually be defeated by an individual, or small group of three or so.  

Demons, Fae and Gods almost never come do stuff personally, almost entirely
working through agents and lieutenants.  Not all Fae are antagonistic, about
a third of them can be considered generally friendly towards humans, while
about two thirds of gods are friendly.

`WSyntax:`x Enrapture (target) `x Enrapture break

Enrapture is a mystical power that makes a person fall in love with the
user.  The victim must be helpless for the command to work.  Like other
forms of mind control while in Haven it doesn't work to violate Sanctuary
but is otherwise one of the most powerful forms of enslavement there is. 
The victim will believe themselves head over heels in love with the user and
willing to do almost anything to make them happy.  It can only be used on
one person at a time.  When the effect wears off the victim will realize
they were manipulated, but will believe their actions were less out of
character than they truly were.

`WSyntax:`x Enthrall (target)
`x        Enthrall break

Enthralling is an abomination power that can only be used on helpless
targets.  When used it places the target entirely in your thrall, they will
have to obey any order given to them.  It can be broken with enthrall break,
and breaks automatically if the abomination dies.  

Somewhat uniquely for mind control an enthralled target is aware they're
enthralled and does not wish to follow their orders, but is compelled to
anyway, a great exertion of will is only able to delay follow an order by a
second.  

Enthralled targets are compelled to obey what they believe their master
meant, not the literal words of an order, and so can't try to loophole
things semantically.  

An enthralled target will see 'Your master' in the look info of their master
generally and will see memory cloaked masters as 'Your master' instead of
their normal nondescript intro.  An abomination can only have one person
enthralled at a time.  
 
If a character dies while enthralled, their master also dies.
This effect lasts for a few hours to a day or two past when
the bond ends, much longer if the enthralled person is badly injured,
bloodaured or tainted for breaking the understanding.

Memory cloak is a power that allows the user to force others to forget their appearance as soon as they see them; people will always recall them as utterly nondescript and ordinary, and be unable to describe their appearance to others afterwards.  They also project a little static with his power, which causes them to show up as blurs on cameras when using it.  
 
Mechanically, when using a memory cloak characters won't be seen to move or in room lists in public rooms. They will be targetable if they draw attention to themselves, but will appear as nondescript men or women.  People who try to look for them too often however will lose the ability to spot them.  Supernaturally aware characters will be able to recognize a memory cloak after they've drawn attention to themselves. 
 
Looking at someone under a memory cloak gives you about a fifty percent chance to recall one detail about them the next time you sleep, but there's also a high chance you could end up remembering a detail wrong.  
 
Memory cloak won't work if the character stands out in some dramatic way, such as being masked, naked, or in a non-human shape.

after their birth.  Either by a higher power such as a Fae or God or by a
human practitioner of fleshforming magic.  They often have been improved by
the process, made more attractive of more physically adept but also may have
been given inhuman characteristics.  Unfortunately such a process makes the
Sanctuary spell that protects Haven unable to recognize them as human any
longer, and they can never be protected by it.  After taking this modifier

Abilities are special types of stats, each one has five ranks and unlocks a
new power with each rank.  They can be used in combat with ability
(abilityname) (target or argument) or in most cases just (abilityname)
(target or argument)

The first ability you have every rank of the stat will cost 1 point, the
second ability you have every rank will cost 2 points and so on up to five. 
Once you have left newbie school.
 
You can only use each ability power once per fight with a few
exceptions, but this will reset once you've used all, or almost all
your ability powers.
 
Abilities can also be used in RP, in general each discreet ability
power can be used once per RP scene, unless otherwise indicated by
the SR.
 
Showability can be used to show the room that you have a certain
ability.

Text `WSyntax:`x Territory/Territory info (territory)/Territory
(north/south/asia/africa/europe/australasia/wilds/godrealm/other)

Territories are areas of supernatural control within the world, usually
centered around some city and extending out until they meet another
territory.  Typically happening along naturalistic borders such as states or
countries.  The thee societies tend to have some influence in every
territory, although it can vary wildly.  

Statuses:

Goverened: This means that an area is controlled by a particular alliance,
they set and enforce the laws for supernaturals in that area and likely have
a great deal of influence over the human side of it as well.  

Shared: This means an area is controlled by more than one group, with them
sharing power in some way.  They might share it based on different parts of
the territory, on on different responsibilities.  

Contested: This occures when two or more alliances are actively trying to
take responsibility for the same things in conflicting ways.  Both trying to
enforce their set of laws and so forth.  It also indicates a struggle for
increased control over the territory, although at this level it is not a
violent struggle.  

War: This happens when societies in a contested territory escalate into using
violence against one another.  Outright street combat is still rare, with
societies generally prefering to destroy each other's assets, such as setting
fires, or steal or saboutage each other's property or vassals.  Over time
however violence tends to increase, to beating other society's agents and
surrogates, to beating society members and eventually outright killing each
other off.  

Wild: This means that nobody really controls the area, while you're free to
do as you wish, others as also fee to kill you if they don't like what you
did.  

Conflict:

Few territories are free of conflict forever, it tends to be cyclical.  A
territory will start off as goverend or shared, then some event will tip
them into contested, they will eventually either settle back into
goverened/shared or it will escalate into war.  The war will grow more
violent until the parties eventually settle back into some goverened/shared
state.  And eventually that will kick back off into contested etc.  

The scale of violence and type of violence in conflicts is largely
determined by the type of territory.  Supernatural violence is camouflaged
into human violence, and thus in a city with heavy gang crime supernatural
wars take place disguised as gang wars, in a wartorn city, supernatural wars
take place disguised as insurgent conflicts and the like.  In territories
with low violent crime, supernatural conflicts involve very little violence
themselves.  

Control:

The control percent indicates the average chance a society would be able to
achieve something on the human side of things in that territory, such as
getting someone arrested or having a building licence approved.  The areas
of control are:
Law Enforcement: Control or influence over police officers, captains, jail
wardens or judges.  With judges usually being the most sought after.  
Government: Control or influence over politicians and especially their
staff, who're typically much more reliable.  
The People: Control or influence over the media, or highly respected and
influential people.  
Money: Control or influence over the rich, possession of or influence over
large businessess.  
Land: Being able to monitor and deploy soldiers or surrogates to physical
territory such as street blocks.  
Property: Societies particularly like to own residential developements,
apartment buildings and hotels as they can work magic to influence those
that sleep there or even feed from them psychically. Owning commercial
buildings is also sought after but offers less control.

Conflicts over territory usually involve societies trying to obtain more of
these things, or trying to deprive them from their enemies.  If a society
wants help with a territory from players it's likely for similar reasons.  

Ettiquette:

When entering a new territory, either to stay there or to perform some
mission there it's usually considered proper to ask permission from the
governing supernatural body.  Not doing so means you may be picked up for
trespassing, the likelyhood of which depends on the amount of control the
society has.  In conflicted regions or regions involved in wars it's easier
to get by without seeking permission, although if you're identified as an
enemy things will still go badly for you.
 
`WMap`x:
You can view the current territories on the online map by going to,
havenrpg.net/worldmap.bmp
(Warning large file size, approx 4.5MB)
In this map territories are red if contested, bright red with a bullseye
if in a warstate. And white, purple or green if beloning to another
alliance.
Striped territories
represent shared ones. As control increases or decreases the
size of the territory circles will also increase or decrease.
This map updates once a day, or automatically after most
types of territory change.
 
`WStoryrunners:`x
SRs can use territory timeline (territory) (message) To add something to a
a territory's timeline after completing an adventure there.
After completing an adventure storyline finale they can use
territory government/people/places/notes/timeline (territory) or

(Name of subfaction) to alter an existing territory, they can also transfer
this power to someone else with territory refer (person).

Text Supernatural forces have existed for as long as mankind, but they used to be fairly primitive.  There were no monsters or gods, just tribal shamans and priests whose powers were rather limited except when they made human sacrifices.  The other worlds were closer to earth however, and people often accidentally stumbled from one to another.  

This first began to change in Mesopotamia around 8500BCE, Sorcerers began to develop in earnest, and the knowledge of magical forces increased.  These sorcerers broke into several dynastic lines, teaching their children their knowledge following an oral tradition.  Experiments in fleshforming started around 2000 years later, and in 6000BCE the first reports of vampires and werewolves occurred.  Several sorcerous dynasties combined with the rise of the Sumarians to form what's now known as the Council of Babylon, despite at the time it existing in Kish, some distance from where Babylon would be erected.  The council existed on other worlds as well, having determined ways to walk between them and was the ruling power in most other earth-like planes.  They were also spreading to the developing Egypt.  The Council were immortal and in 2400 BCE the first God was created.  

The council continued to grow in influence, and spread with civilization, many of the oldest and most powerful members were now Gods whilst others were simply immortal.  In 1800 BCE in one of the other realms, known as Sirinia at the time, two of the more powerful members fell into a feud over a woman.  The feud grew in fervor and the rest of the council in that plane eventually joined sides.  As the war raged, no longer really about a woman, each side turned to more and more dangerous fleshforming until they lost control over their fleshformed creatures.  The council members in other planes worked quickly to seal Sirinia away from themselves, so that what had been created could not break free, that world is now known colloquially as Hell.  

Shortly afterwards on the east coast of the Mediterranean sea rose the first group of anti-supernatural warriors, who were set on destroying any supernatural creation and severing the ties to other worlds under their leader Abraham, himself some kind of immortal although he was not a vampire or sorcerer.  The group made good progress for a hundred years until they came into brutal conflict with the council and were sorely defeated, the people broken and scattered, although their descendants would eventually come together again in Canaan around 1400 BCE as the first of the Israelites.  

This kingdom began to grow again, quietly, keeping largely to itself although anti-supernatural sentiment still ran strong, just when it had started to reach real power the council of Babylon, remembering the war with the Israelites ancestors used the Kingdom of Babylon to smash the Kingdom of Judah, destroying the First Temple and sending most of their people once more into exile, this time mostly in Babylon and Egypt.  With their common enemy crushed the council began to drift apart and few new members were accepted, they each began to work on separate projects and it was during this time that great empires began to develop in Greece, Persia, India, China, South America and eventually Rome.  

Alexander the great was the son of one of the most powerful councilmembers and constituted the last serious involvement in the affairs of men by the council.  He was eventually slain by another who was able to subvert his protections and the council fell to bickering amongst themselves, until they settled upon an accord of non interference with the world.  An accord which they would frequently break, but generally only in small or deniable ways.  They accepted no new members, and vigilantly protected the secrets of fleshforming.  

The withdrawal of the Council created something of a power vacuum and it was filled by several new groups by around 300BCE.  They were mostly made up of the descendants of those whod served the council of Babylon in some way, priests, companions or servants.  Those whod seen the use of magic and had some idea on how to go about it, or where to look for clues to go about it.  Relatively weak councils formed in South America, Western Europe, and Scandenavia now typically called the Incan Council, the Druidic Council, and the Viking Council.  A significantly more powerful one formed in China, known as the Eastern Council, and by far the most powerful formed in Italy, known as the Council of Rome.  The Roman council had many advantages over the others, being close to the seat of Alexanders power, and the closest to Babylon and all the artifacts and knowledge of that area.  Despite their relative power they had no access to the higher mystical arts or to fleshforming, and many turned to vampirism as a way to extend their lives and authority.  Rome became the vampire capital of the world even as it grew much more powerful under the guiding hand of the Roman Council.  

Meanwhile the Israelites slowly began to pick themselves back up leading eventually to the formation of the Hasmonean Dynasty in 165 BCE.  Remembering the history of the Israelites as powerful anti-supernatural warriors the Council of Rome pushed Rome into invading and conquering Judaea in 63 BCE.  By 50BCE the Incan council had fallen apart, and the Viking council had fragmented into several warring sects, meanwhile the Eastern Council grew in strength and formed into the group called The Dynasty.  

In 33 AD the new religion of Christianity was formed out of that of Judaism, and although nobody noticed much at first it's influence started to rapidly spread, almost as if it was being supernaturally aided.  In 64 AD The council of Rome had noticed this disturbing upswing in the influence of the descendants of Israel and Emperor Nero blamed Christians for the great Fire of Rome that year, creating a massive wave of persecution against Christians throughout the Empire.  In spite of this however, the new religion continue to flourish and many of it's supplicants in secret began working against the supernatural.  More and more ties to the other realms became broken and the Gods finally decided to leave Earth to make their primary residence in another plane, many of the lesser councilmembers who hadn't attained full godhood broke away into their own faction and founded a Golden city in yet another realm in this period leading up to around 300AD, a few remaining on earth and instead heading north away from civilization.  These lesser members are now known as the Fae.  

When Christianity was finally adopted by the Roman Empire officially it was considered a great victory against the council of Rome and ever since the supernatural have been pushed into hiding.  It was around this time when the council of Rome started to be known as Manus, or The Hand.  While the anti-supernatural faction within Christianity and Judaism was called The Temple.  In 150 AD what was left of the Viking council fell to a growing faction of werewolves in Scandinavia.  

The Druidic council, long forgotten to the northwest grew strong under the influence of the Fae who traveled there instead of to the Golden City, far removed from the area in which the struggles between the supernatural and natural occurred, from Babylon and the old gates to hell much greater trust existed between the Druids and their people, and they practiced magic openly.  

While the Hand and Temple fought for control of Rome, the long forgotten and newly powerful druidic council, or as it came to be known, the Order, and it's barbarian tribes began to push south, culminating in the collapse of the Western Roman Empire.  At the same time, the Dynasty were being heavily punished by the Mongols and their shamans.  

During most of the Medieval period control of Europe was divided between the Hand, the Order and the Temple.  The Temple had control of Spain, and Russia, as well as influence in the middle east, whereas the Hand still controlled Italy and England, with the Order retaining control of most of the rest of Europe.  The Temple's influence through Christianity however exerted a heavy hand and they were the most powerful faction for most of this time, all supernaturals needing to exist in secret.  The Viking lands to the north remained largely uncontrolled by the factions, instead being the home to several powerful packs of werewolves.  

The factions and their agent empires continued to wage war throughout Europe, until the Industrial revolution.  The rise of science diminished the powers of the supernaturals comparatively, while the declining power of religion damaged the Temple.  The factions continued to compete however through attempts to out expand each other, with The Hand locking down territory in Australia and North America, the Order also found some purchase in north America while the Temple claimed much of central and South America.  


At around 1900 the power structure was as follows: The Order controlled most of Canada, and southeastern US.  They also controlled most of Central Europe, and Ireland.  The Hand controlled the economic centers of the US, Italy, Egypt, England and Australiasia, The Temple controlled Mexico, Peru and Brazil, Russia and some parts of the US, particularly central and southern US.  They also controlled Russia, and had a fair hand in the middle east.  Another group, calling themselves the Dynasty held most of Asia, while central south America, and Africa were controlled by regional shamans with little progress being made by the factions into those areas.  Scandinavia continued to be werewolf territory.  The Hand managed to take control of France from The Order, and this kicked off world war one, beginning with a coup in Italy organized by the Order and then their backing of the powers of Germany to try to reclaim France and then England, pushing The Hand entirely out of Europe.  The Temple originally stayed out of the conflict, but then eventually joined on the side of The Hand when it seemed like the Order might be too successful.  The Order was eventually defeated and went into a period of remission, with the Hand reclaiming Italy.  

The supernatural group responsible for world war two is unclear, but the effect upon the supernatural world was massive.  All three of the great supernatural factions at the time were broken, most of their members dead or fled they splintered into hundreds of different groups.  

The cold war between Russia and the United States exacerbated affairs with numberous secrective groups forming and dissolving every few years as supernaturals fought for influence in the shadows.  

This patterned continued even after the cold war ended with supernaturally aware societies fighting for influence in increasingly complicated and sophisticated ways.

`WSyntax:`x Dream Snare (dreamworld number) (victim)

If you can locate a character in the physical realm while you wander the
nightmare while dreaming as a spectre you can force them into a 
dreamworld with you with the dream invade command. It costs 3% of your
Life force to use or 1.5% if the target is affected by Mandrake tea.
 
If the target is already a member of that dreamworld their existing identity
will be suspended while they enter as a new character based on their physical
identity. The invader has dreamgod powers over them for the duration of the
invasion.

The target can reclaim their old identity with dreamworld (number) reactivate.
They can even do this during the invasion, but that would put their normal
identity at the mercy of the invader.

When used with snare instead of invade the ability costs 9% LF or 4.5 if
under the effects of Mandrake but the victim can't be woken up by normal
means. Instead a character must enter the same dreamworld, find them and
then use dreamworld rescue on them.
 
Dreamgod powers include the ability to blind, probe, noaction, nomove, drag
newintro and newdesc. More information about these commands can be found in

Text This is a set of guidelines on where PC death will likely occur in staff
run stories.  Player SRs may deviate from these guidelines although
preferably not by too much.  

Things that will almost certainly lead to your PCs death:

`D1`r)`x Disrespecting the threat.  If your char acts like they can't die or are
unafraid of death in an unrealistic manner, they're highly likely to die. 
An example might be meeting a god, and insulting them, this will likely
cause immediate death.  

`D2`r)`x Doing something that would realistically cause death.  You can't expect
SRs to be nice and throw you miracle saves, if you jump off a tall building,
you're almost certainly going to die.  

`D3`r)`x Doing something brave and dangerous.  If you tackle the super powered
evil to try and buy your friends time to escape, expect to die.  

`D4`r)`x Doing something unrealistic or silly, or trying to powergame through
dangerous situations.  If you're in a big fight and start for instance,
singing a song, expect to die.  

Things which are likely to lead to your PCs death:

`D1`r)`x Doing something brave.  Every time your character is brave in a scene
there's a serious chance they might die, that's what makes it brave.  

`D2`r)`x Doing something dangerous.  Every time your character does something
dangerous, such as gets into a fight there's a serious chance they might
die.  

There is no limit to the number of people who will die in a scene, if lots
of people are doing the above listed things then lots of people might die. 
There is no need for an SR or staff member to work you up through injury
levels, although they might you should not be surprised if you go from
healthy to dead if the situation warrants it.  

The only way to ensure your survival in staff run plots is to be cunning and
cowardly.  Obviously many people don't want to play like that, which is
fine, but you should not have the expectation of surviving plots if so, the
price for being a hero is most often your life.

Text Ghosts are the imperfect copies created when a character whether NPC or PC dies.
Not all deaths create ghosts and the exact mechanism for doing so is unknown,
however many ghosts become obsessed with particular aspects of their previous
life.  Whether this is due to regret, being unable to let go, or simply because
of the brain-damage like condition in which all ghosts exist isn't clear.
 
Each ghost is as unique as the person who spawned it.  They're unable to change,
but retain much of the special abilities they possessed in life.  Though ghosts
have no concrete form and can move through otherwise solid objects, any ghost
who could not fly when they were alive, for example, is similarly bound in death
if only by the belief that flying isn't possible.  Ghosts who die while shifted
will be shifted ghosts and unable to shift back into human form.  Ghosts who
were not shifted when they died will not be able to shift into their alternative
form any more.
 
Ghosts may not enter the Lodge or any home which has been ritually warded. 
Furthermore, they are generally bound to Haven and can't leave the city.  They
can only be seen by characters with clairvoyance and only heard by characters with
clairaudience.  Characters without either of these supernatural stats can detect
when a ghost enters or leaves a room with perception however and the higher that
character's perception, the more likely they will notice the ghost's movement. 
Movement in peripheral rooms can not be detected in the same way.
 
Ghosts do not precisely occupy the same space as the living and interacting with
them and their world is strenuous.  Though they may interact with other characters
who possess either clairaudience or clairvoyance with less restrictions, player
ghosts receive a pool of actions each day to represent their endurance.  This
pool is referred to as willpower and will be visible with the score command as a
ghost.  Willpower will not be depleted for actions taken which do not attempt to
breach the veil between the spirit and living spaces. Ghost walkers receive half
as much willpower to expend each day to represent their investment in the
corporeal world.

Some examples of actions that require manifestation are moving an object,
touching another character, being able to been seen or heard plainly, or
utilizing one of their supernatural powers.  Verbal actions in particular are
especially difficult for ghosts and even the most powerful ghosts can only
muster concrete language in a low voice or whisper.  Despite being able to
interact with their environment in limited ways, ghosts may not engage or be
engaged in combat.
 
`cSyntax`g: `Wvisible`x
  For ghosts, this command toggles whether or not the ghost is attempting to be
  visible in their next action.  Toggling it doesn't eat away at any specific
  uses per day however while it is active, the ghost will be considered to be
  manifesting as well.  This will replace "something unseen" with `Wemote`x and
  in actions with the ghost's name or intro depending on whether or not the
  ghost is known to the viewer.  A special prefix "the ghost of" is attached
  before the ghost's intro or name in the event that the viewer has at least
  clairvoyance 1 and can recognize the nature of the ghost immediately.
 
`cSyntax`g: `Wmanifest`x
  This toggle allows ghosts to determine whether or not the ghost will attempt
  to perform an action which can be detected without supernatural aid.  This is
  both a safety mechanism to prevent ghosts from depleting their daily pools
  unwittingly and to differentiate between the limited and unlimited version of
  some commands such as `Wsay`x, `Wemote`x, and `Wprivate`x.
 
`cWillpower Costs`g:`x
  Private         10
  Emote           15
  Manifestations  20
  Speech          25
 
`cNote`g:`x If an action qualifies for multiple categories, it will use the greater
  cost.
 
Some rituals such as `Wbinding`x, `Wunbinding`x, and `Wbanishment`x can effect ghosts.

Adventures are tasks given by one or two subfactions to a set of players,
Haven is a source of many capable supernaturals and is a natural recruiting
ground for when these subfactions wish for aid. Some are given by a single
subfac, some by two working together(joint) and some are two working against
each other(competative).

Adventures usually take place outside Haven, either on earth or offworld.
They may be one roleplaying session or several, at the conclusion of them
the subfactions will reward those who took part in a variety of ways. The
rewards are relatively minor, since going on an adventure is supposed to
be enjoyable in and of itself. The rewards also decrease a little if more
people are included, and are three times higher in competative adventures
since there is a chance of getting no reward at all if your side loses.

Players may sign up for adventures with plot apply, and leave a comment if
they wish, they'll automatically be given a rating then indicating how well
liked they are by that subfaction, generally speaking SRs should take the
highest rated players on their adventure, but they might make exceptions
if a high rated person wants to bring a friend as mentioned in their comment
or cannot make the times when the adventure is to happen.

People who take part in many adventures will have a natural penalty to this
rating.

While each subfaction has lists of common allies, enemies and tasks, these
are guidelines, feel free to come use other alliances/tasks or enmities if
they make sense.

Help Subfactions give a list of all subfactions.
 
A Quest is a special type of adventure, targeted at a particular player

list/info/create/type/permissions/description/npcs/lore/secrets/submit/clai-
/unclaim/approvelock/sponsor/deny/territory/makeplot/galleryadd/gallerydelete
/mastermind <number> <argument>

This command allows anyone to submit an idea for a story, the idea might be
about their PC, it might be something they want to do with their SR, or
might just be a thing they thought of.  

To create a storyidea simply use storyidea create, then storyidea list to
see it's number, from then you can fill out the fields.  The
description/npcs/and lore fields are mandatory, if npcs and lore don't
apply, simply put 'None' in their fields.  

The type can be adventure, joint, competitive if you want to run an
adventure.  Quest or personal for a personal, targeted story.  Or other in
all other cases.  

The description can be as short of long as you'd like, and contain IC and
OOC info, but keep in mind it's good to give some creative freedom to the SR
who'll be running the story.  

The secrets field will not be seen by anyone until it's claimed, although
staff can look at if if they want to.  Staff may edit a storyidea before
approving it, usually in cases where there's only one or two small issues

The permissions filed allows a player submitting a personal idea type to
select which SRs will be able to claim it, and can be edited even after the
storyidea is approved.  

Whoever submits an idea has 24 hours after it is approved where only they
will be able to claim it.  You can also unclaim a plot, allowing someone
else to claim it.  

There are several types of approval, aside from normal approval there's also
timed approval, this is an automatic approval that happens if a storyidea
hasn't been dealt with in 5 days, it allows for the possibility of the staff
being somehow unable to do their jobs, sponsored means it's been approved
and the staff want it run for whatever reason, like it being part of a staff
story.  Locked means it's been approved but isn't available for claiming
yet.  This may be because of an overabundance of similar plots for instance.

Finally, using storyidea makeplot <number> <title> allows you to turn a
story idea you've claimed into a full blown plot, with some of the
information that was in the storyidea put on.  You would still need to add
more information, but it's a quick and easy way to change storyideas into
plots.  

Sponsored storyideas award bonus karma when claimed, and all adventure types
award some karma when claimed and completed.  

Using this system is mandatory for any SR action that's more than just
ambience or involves supernatural elements.  
 
When setting a `Wmastermind`w for a storyidea, it is important to remember 
to include references to the mastermind in the storyidea. Not doing so will
mean the mastermind will be stripped from it.

Text Plots can be generally categorized as one of three types, small, medium
or large.  SRs should try to do a balance of all three types.  

Small plots involve a small group of players, generally five or less.  They
have no large ramifications on the world or town, they involve either no
combat or no supernatural elements.  If they involve supernatural elements
these are established ones.  They are particularly suited to person plots
focused around a person and their history, non supernatural problems, or
investigations.  

Medium plots can involve more players than small, but do not involve the
entire game.  Their consequences and ramifications do not effect the world
or the entire town.  Supernatural elements should still be established ones,
combat should be reasonable in scope, so as to not involve destruction of
buildings etc.  They're particularly suited to society plots, mysteries,
horror stories or to types similar to small but of large scope and
supernatural impact.  

Large plots are anything that doesn't fit into the other two categories,
they may involve large conflicts, new lore, heavy supernatural elements etc.
Obviously new lore must still be run by staff and permission for these sorts
of plots is usually required as they will impact more players than just
those who've trusted you.

Text Characters may become pregnant through use of the sex command.  Many factors are
involved, but primarily whether or not sex occurs during the fertility window
surrounding ovulation, when precisely it occurs, and the potency of the male's
contribution.  Contraceptives work against the chance that a character may
become pregnant and are generally effective.

Menstruation is the outward sign of female fertility, but both sexes have
components which render them more or less fertile.  For females, this is
mostly the timing at which they have unprotected sex and when they ovulate.
Men, however, have to worry about how many times they have sex, protected or
otherwise, within a certain span of time.  A man who has sex every day still has
the potential to impregnate a woman, however, the chance of it occurring is
substantially lower as are their opportunities to do so.

Neither female nor male vampires are considered fertile according to the code at
this time.
 
Should a character become pregnant, she will be subject to an extra string of
look information describing her state.  This may be obscured during early phases
by wearing concealing clothing, but will always be visible during later stages.
 
Prior to showing, a character can test whether they have become pregnant by
using a pregnancy test via the use command.  Any object containing the keywords
pregnancy and test can be used in this way and doing so will cause the character
to urinate on the object.  This also sets the item's value to 0.  These tests
are generally ineffective before the character misses their next period.
 
Characters may be subject to additional effects throughout the duration of the
pregnancy to ensure that players behave and are reminded of the reality of their
situation.
 
In the event that a character suffers a severe wound or greater, there will be
the possibility of a miscarriage.  Players who are pregnant or suspect they may
be pregnant should take great care to avoid dangerous situations.  Attempts to
intentionally cause a miscarriage by other players constitutes an Understanding
violation.  Miscarriages otherwise never result as a random chance and are
always attributable to character negligence or intent.
 
Should a character wish to willingly terminate a pregnancy for any reason, she
may use the procedure pregnancy command.  This command may also be used in the
event that the character wishes to become pregnant via an NPC donor.  The cost
of beginning a pregnancy is substantially higher than the costs of terminating
one though both are prohibitive.  The cost of terminating a pregnancy depends
on how long the pregnancy has been allowed to continue prior to the use of the
command.  Pregnancies beyond twenty four weeks can't be terminated as per
Massachusetts unless the mother is at risk.  Since that isn't an issue presented
by the code, pregnancies can not be terminated beyond twenty four weeks.
 
`cSyntax`g: `Wchange pregnancy`x
  Toggles the character's pregnancy state.  This command requires a medical
  facility and has a cost associated with it depending on whether or not the
  character is already pregnant.  Using this command while pregnant will inflict
  a minor wound on the character.

usage penalties that will ultimately lead to their failure during future use.

three categories (coital, noncoital, and outercourse) based on what they would
most commonly be used for depending on the target.  This differs somewhat based
on whether the action is initiated by a man or a woman and whether the sex is
hetero or homosexual.  Alternative arguments can be tested with the sex category
syntax to discover how the game will interpret the position or act.  If it's
unrecognized, it will inform the player and log the bad argument so that the
command can become more intuitive and accommodate additional player requests
that the coder did not originally provision for.

Text Menstruation in Haven is a coded reality.  All females who are at least 13 and
no older than 50 will be subject to messages periodically.  Vampires are
exempt.  The messages are intended to give the player an indication of their
cycle though most of the effects are hidden.  Any more detail is at the
discretion of each individual player as is how they bring their cycle into
their roleplay.

Cycles have a high degree of potential variability, but are weighted in such a
way that an average cycle is far more likely than a short or long one.
Ovulation, which too is variable, occurs on day 14 of an average 28 day cycle.
Menstruation is suspended upon a character becoming pregnant and will resume
sometime after the pregnancy comes to its natural conclusion or is terminated
prematurely.

Keyword Lore Primer~

Text The most important thing to understand about Haven lore is that it is a
pseudo scientific, logical take on the supernatural.  That means that the
supernatural doesn't overtly contradict known science such as evolution or
the laws of physics.  Issues like creation of energy are dealt with through
drawing it from another dimension etc.  

It's a world that's largely built upon our own, the fae, gods and most big
demons all used to be humans, before fleshforming themselves into other
things, and retain their human core.  The monsters and creatures were all
made by these beings, for some purpose.  

We took this approach for two reasons, the first is simple credibility, the
second is to make it easier to access for a player.  When encountering a
monster you can use your reason to think about who made this, and why and
from what to make intelligent guesses about it's characteristics, when
dealing with gods etc you can apply some of your understanding of human
psychology similarly.  This allows players and characters to think about
challenges and discuss them intelligently, without needing huge amounts of
lore.  

This system and the lore of fleshforming can allow for a huge variety of
stories, and give a lot of creative freedom to SRs, however it also can make
it challenging to copy stories directly from mythology or fantasy settings. 
Since things need to make some sort of sense, and often issues of folklore
etc, do not.  

Regarding death and religion, the game deliberately doesn't prove or
disprove the existence of higher gods, if humans have a soul there's no
proof of it, and it goes off to wherever it goes when someone dies.  There
is however proof of psychic transference, which is to say minds or parts of
minds being copied or replicated into other things.  Ghosts are one such
phenomena, where a part of someone's mind transfers into a psychic
non-physical medium when they die.  It is never a perfect copy however,
memories will be missing, their behaviour may be odd or particularly
fixated, much like someone who has sustained some brain damage.  Vampires
are another instance, a near perfect transference of their mind from their
brain to a psychic medium inside their blood.  

Strictly speaking, resurrection is impossible, but beings capable of
fleshforming can remake individuals.  Much like ghosts the mind of the new
individual is imperfect, often missing memories or having flaws or oddities
in their behaviour, they're remade more accurately the more information the
being has on them, such as their recent body, or memories of people who knew
them, or a ghost of them, but it's never ever a perfect remake.  
People brought back may be brought back different from how they
originally were on purpose as well.

Text `WSyntax:`x habit/ habit (category) (amount/frequency)

The Habit command is used to set your characters offline habits, this serves
several purposes.  Firstly it's visible to trusted SRs when they look you
up, and can give them a good idea of what your character is about.  Secondly
it helps players themselves think about what their character does and thus
what they should know.  

Habits also can have code ramifications, but these are generally small and
bi-directional, so a small buff and small nerf to prevent there being any
optimum habit set.  

Habits are very important for some archetypes however.  Demonborns can use
them to set how often they generally give into their demonic sadism.  Based
on this setting they may occasionally get a message that they were mean to
someone the day before, it's up to them to RP what actually happened.  

Vampires use it to set their feeding habits, careful is the default and
means the vampire takes care when selecting victims to choose those they
think will survive.  These kill about one a year and have a small chance of
going hungry.  Animal setting vampires feed on animals and bagged blood,
they never kill anyone but are less healthy and often hungry.  Reckless are
vampires who don't care about human lives, they kill about 3 a year and
never go hungry.  

Vampires have a small chance when they logon to get a message about having
killed someone the day previous.  It's up to them to RP how/why this
happened.  They will be tainted for this as well, but nobody will have any
real way of knowing they were responsible to aura them, unless they tell
them.  

Werewolves can use the command to set what they do during the full moon. 
Calmed means they take efforts to keep themselves calm, such as taking
valium on the full moon.  Chained means they keep themselves locked up
during the full moon.  Careless means they go about their business as usual,
and embracing means they embrace the lunacy.  Depending on these factors
Werewolves have a chance to get a message about having killed or seriously
injured someone the day before, again they'll be tainted and it's up to them
to RP what happened.  

You are free to RP accidentally killing/seriously injuring someone on your
characters even when you don't get a message, in fact we'd encourage most
new vampires/weres to do a scene on the first time they accidentally kill
someone, as that's a character defining moment.

Causes all storyrunner commands, such as summon, to not even request and to
become completely voided.  

None
Like Negative, except story runner commands such as summon will request your
permission before being attempted.  Anything that codedly effects your
character, such as injure, will not work at all.  

Basic
At this level, SR's Lookup command will only return your Character notes. 
(Help character Notes) The probe command will echo to the SR what a
particular disc or stat is at, but also echo to the player what they've
probed.  Injure can be used to injure a PC to a mild wound.  Conditions will
only remain on players as long as they are in the room an SR is running
(Help Conditions)

Moderate
Lookup will now return your character's history as well as your character
notes.  Probing will no longer return what the SR has looked up about your
character.  Injure can be used to injure a PC to a severe wound.  Conditions
now remain on PC's for a duration of 24 IG hours, or until cured manually. 
Summon will now bring along PC's without requesting their permission.  

Advanced
Includes Moderate changes.  Injure can now be used to injure a PC to a
Critical wound, or to inflict a fatal wound, killing them.  Conditions now
remain on PC's for a duration of 54 IG hours, or until cured manually.  SR's
can now see your RP remotely unless you are in a private room (Help
Private)

Universal
Depending on the total trust within a room, SR's can create Monsters to
fight PC's with discs equivalent to the amount of trust given.  The hurt
command reduces a player's defenses based on the trust level that player has
in the SR using the command.

Text There's a few things it's important to keep in mind when playing
Angelborn.  Angelborn are to some extent natural victims, the fact that they
can be more powerfully hypnotized and in general more easy to coerced often
leads to them being an ideal choice if someone's looking for a victim or
sidekick etc.  You shouldn't play a character like this if you're too
worried about bad things happening to them.  Also though, and probably more
importantly, angelborn are particularly resistant to angst.  Even if one is
captured and tortured while the torture is going on they want it a little
bit, not enough to be ok with it, but it is not as bad as for others, and
afterwards they're surrounded by people who want them to get over it. 
Either because they're their friends and want them to feel better, or
because they find it irritating.  Which through their empathy causes them to
rebound fairly quickly.  This is important because it means Angelborn are an
extremely poor choice of character if you're seeking to RP the aftermath or
seek sympathy.

Text Some people on the internet derive satisfaction from making others
unhappy.  Maybe they feel it's warranted and they've been wronged somehow or
maybe they just do it for funs.  In either case this leads to behavior we
class as griefing and is considered abusive Roleplay.  

For something to be considered griefing, it generally is something that is
targeted at a player, not a character.  Most intelligent griefers will come
up with IC justifications or fabrications to excuse their behavior however
so discerning what is bad can be tricky.  For this reason it's our policy to
only target instances in which the behavior is clearly excessive, and at
least two staff members agree, none of which can be involved in the instance
in question with any alts etc.  

Some things that would count as griefing are:

Becoming aware of a mistake in someone's background and using that mistake
to attack the character ICly without at least first informing them OOCly of
the mistake.  

Characters having grudges against other characters which carry over multiple
chars of theirs.  

Characters joining in grudges held by their OOC friends.  

Characters behaving in ways designed to make life miserable for an enemy
player instead of their character, e.g. spamming.  

Characters attacking others for reasons that make no sense for their
character, or to extremes that make no sense given their causes.  

Attempts to use the code in ICly illogical or abusive ways to attack
someone.  

Examples might be spamming, getting killed by a PC only to design a new char
to go after you killer, spending all your influence to diss someone for no
rational reason or a made up reason etc.  

If you have any questions on what might constitute griefing, or are worried
about something you've done being considered as such, please query the
staff.

Keyword Story Runner Code of Conduct~

Level 0
Online 0
Type 0
Text The story runner code of conduct has one aim, to ensure SRs are
concentrating on helping make and run great RP.  As an SR you are subject to
immortal oversight, that means that unlike a player you do not have to
clearly break any rules for immortals to intervene, if we feel like you are
using your SR in a way that is bad for the game we will take it away from
you.

`W1`R)`x Do not grief players.  This means using your SR in any way to make
player's lives unpleasant unless as a direct and necessary part of the
story.  Using NPCs to pick on players, having monsters go after one in
particular for no real reason, using hurt/injure excessively etc.
 
`W2`R)`x Do not coddle players.  This means using your SR in any way to inflate
player's egos unless as a direct and necessary part of the story.  Using
NPCs to flatter players, designing fights and scenarios that they can't
possibly lose or letting them win the situation even if you think they
should lose etc.  In general a good success rate is about 75%, if players
succeed about 75% of the time in your stories you're probably at a good
level.

`W3`R)`x Never attempt to influence a player to increase your trust level.  While
you may tell a player you don't want to run RP for them because their trust
is too low you may not ever harass, plead or pressure a player into raising
your trust.  This is to protect you more than them, if they are unhappy with
something you've done the fact that they completely voluntarily raised your
trust high enough to do it is your best defense.
 
`W4`R)`x Do not use your SR to prop up or help your characters.  Your characters
can be involved in rooms and stories that you run but they should never
profit from it.  For instance if your players have to solve a puzzle, your
character should never be the one with the answer.  They should be one of
the group and in no way gain any possible advantage because you are also the
SR.
 
`W5`R)`x Do not allow your SR to give any benefit to your PC.  Most overt examples
would be offering to run RP for people who're nice to your PC more than
others, but even if you're not doing it deliberately you can be held
responsible.  It's very strongly recommended that you do not tell people who
your PC is where possible, as if it seems like people are treating your PC
differently because of that knowledge you may well lose your SR, even if you
aren't encouraging them to do so.
 
`W6`R)`x Do not play favorites.  It is fine to run RP for your friends or people
you like more often.  However when setting up a story you should accept
players based on the merit of their reasons for being involved and that is
all, additionally once in a scene you must treat all players equally and
respond only based on the merits of their IC actions.
 
`W7`R)`x Keep the scope of your stories confined to those who wish to play with
you/trust you.  You should not under normal circumstances run a story that
involves/threatens the entire town/world, or people who aren't volunteering
to play in it.  This includes making the consequences of your plot so dire
that PCs will be unable ICly to avoid getting involved.  It also includes
creating lore that will effect others.  It would be fine for instance to
create a cult for your PCs to deal with, but not to create the oldest
vampire in the world.  Since there can be only one of them.  If you want to
run a plot that involves the whole game, or involves lore creation you'll
need to be deputized and have a staff member be briefed on the plot to ok it
all.  This rule is in place to prevent SRs stepping on each other's stories
and to prevent players from being pushed into participating in plots with
SRs they may not wish to.

`W8`R)`x Keep the scale of your stories reasonable.  While it's an understandable
urge to get players involved by making your plots more and more epic it can
very quickly degenerate the reality of the world and the characters if
they're saving the universe every weekend, and can put SRs in competitions
to make their plot more epic than the last one.  Most stories should be
small scale, something well suited to small groups of players who've trusted
you to play with.  The occasional epic story is fine, although you'll
generally need to pass it through staff and be deputized as mentioned above,
but it's the smaller things that bring the world to life.

Text Story runner are Havens version of what might be Game Masters in other
RPGs.  They are special characters who operate to help create and run RP for
the players.  

They differ to other games in several ways: Firstly they are not staff, and
do not have unlimited powers, they are given several very handy code tools
for doing their job, anybody can become one once they've played the game for
a little while, and their ability to create and run RP is based on a trust
and vote system ensuring no player ever will be in a position where an SR
they don't trust has power over them.  

To become an SR simply type storyrunner (name) and that will begin the
process.  You do not lose your existing character when you do this, but they
will be automatically logged off once the storyrunner creation begins.

SRs automatically attempt to run the RP in any room they enter after a short
delay, but they can't generally been seen moving around, they always appear
as spirits but their name is visible when looking at them.  

SRs can travel around by using the SWalk command, which takes the same
arguments as taxi or travel but is instant and silent, and they can bring
players with them.  They can also make areas in a location called mists,
which they can use to make rooms for any where they want, they can access
all their own rooms made in those areas even if made private.  If they make
rooms status public other SRs will be able to use them also.

All staff are considered SRs and have all the same powers as they do,
players also are set to automatically trust staff, if you wish to turn this
off typing story off will set you as a character that staff doesn't have
trust over, and will indicate you have no interest in staff run stories.  

SRs earn karma from roleplaying and running rooms.  

Players can attempt to contact available online SRs with the STalk command.
 
SRs, either player SRs or immortals are not obligated to SR anything if
they do not wish to, they are free to choose what RP they want to run. If
SRs don't want to run things for you, it might be worth asking why and
working to fix those problems.

which it's built come from an ancient mystical forest and the building
itself is enchanted with many powerful spells.  Weapons disappear from view
inside, almost any violence is impossible and fatigue just lifts off of
people.  Over the decades it has changed to keep up with the times, today it
most closely resembles a diner or perhaps a bar in the evenings.  It's open

So for example if you wanted to do RP based around a catastrophic bridge
being opened between our world and the elemental plane of fire, you could
start off with a broadcast about flames and smoke, then set the atmosphere
to be heavy with smoke and flicking flames.  Perhaps you could then make
smaller fire elementals start to invade the town from within the nightmare,
then set the town to darkness as the smoke obscures the sun.  As the bridge
grows stronger and more severe you could add a constantdamage with a message
like "You are burnt by burning ash", and raise the town's temperature.  Then
some of the elementals might start coming out of the nightmare and into the
town proper, and you could add an erratic damage with a message like.  "A
giant fireball crashes into the ground beside you, sending you flying."  

This is obviously a severe example, but should give an idea of the sorts of
things you can do with the code.

inflict a temporary level one imprint.  

The hardcoded drugs can be either taken by drinking them, or put into a
drink or food object.  To dose a drink or meal with a drug, use `Wpour (drug)
(drink/food)`x

Poison when taken will have no immediate noticeable effect.  It will take
between 20-30 minutes to affect a normal person, about double that for a
supernatural.  Vampires are immune to poison.  When the effect kicks in the
victim will be wounded and weakened, regeneration will not help them heal
this wound.  If someone logs off before the poison has kicked in, it will
kick in when they next log on.  

Rohypnol when taken will have no noticeable or immediate effect.  It will
take 20-30 minutes to effect a normal person, about double that for a
supernatural or three times for a vampire.  When the effect kicks in the
victim will pass out, rendering them helpless and able to be tied up,
dragged around etc.  If someone logs off before the drug kicks in they will
pass out then, disconnected but with their character remaining in the game
in the same way as if they'd been abducted.  You can use the tuckin command
to send a character in this state off the game.

This command can be used in a room where a player has logged off and, if
successful, will bring the unconscious body back into the game where it
can be interacted with.  No one will be able to wake the character until the
player logs back on.  `WAbduct`x can only be used within a few hours of the
target logging off.
 
To determine whether or not the attempt is successful, a number of factors
are taken into consideration based on the abductor's stats, the abductee's
stats, and the location the abduction is taking place in.  Some degree of
luck is accounted for as well.
 
The abductor will get bonuses based on his stealth skill and whether or not
he has legitimate access to the property.
 
The abductee will get bonuses based on his acute senses, fast reflexes,
perception, and, should he be abducted from a house, the household security
and household guards of that location.  If a warding ritual is in place, the
abductee will also be significantly harder to abduct.  An abduction will
always succeed if the abductee is tied up. Abductions cost money and require
cash on hand to cover the costs of the drugs used. The cost will vary depending
on how difficult the person is to abduct, with higher tiers costing more.
 
Unsuccessful attempts may result in the victim fleeing to another property or
the forest.
 
The `Wtuckin`w command can be used to place the character back into a regular 
logged off state.

Text There are many residential properties in Haven that players can buy and
live in.  The `Wdecorate`w command is used to customize houses regardless of
type as long as the player has sufficient privileges.  

Temporary accommodations can be found at the Longhouse, and the Antler. 
The 'Longhouse' provides a communal dormitory, shower, and
stash for each sex and costs nothing to stay.  The Antler Hotel has a number
of individual rooms instead, each with their own shower and stash.  However,
a fee is expected daily and will be assessed at 11AM until the resident

Text Haven is at the center of a soft spot between our world and others, the
known other worlds are listed below.  

`WThe Other`x
Also known as the realm of the Fae.  This is the world from which magic
flows strongest and the one that is naturally closest to ours. It is a world
of strange forests and sweeping planes, filled with monsters, bands of
wildlings and the fabled Golden City.  The Golden City is where the Fae
normally live, from a distance it is incomparably beautiful, shimmering
like a golden diamond day or night.  But nobody who has ventured close to it has ever returned.  

`WThe Godrealm`x
This is the place where the gods reside; it is also supposedly filled with
monsters and wondrous things.  No sane person would ever use gate magic to
access this place, as the Gods often do not take kindly to such things and
do not need bridges to travel to other planes themselves.  

`WHell`x
Hell used to be a world not unlike our own, but a long time ago a vicious
war broke out between two groups of powerful sorcerers, and they turned to
fleshforming to create living weapons to send to the battlefield.  Creatures
with no purpose but to kill, destroy and cause suffering.  As the war
progressed these creatures became more and more deadly until the sorcerers
created creatures capable of creating even better creatures.  From this
point it wasn't long before the entire world was overrun by these living
weapons, now usually called demons.  Magic users from all other planes
sealed the doors between their worlds and hell, trapping them inside.  But
they are always there, and always looking for a way to cross over and carry
out their only goal, to bring death, destruction and misery.  

`WThe Void`x
This is a place that even the forces of hell fear.  The void is nothingness,
a huge black vacuum.  Far from lifeless however it is home to a myriad of
mammoth Cthulian nightmares that float through the darkness and wait for
millions of years in the void, always hungry.  The creatures of the void
have no known disciples on earth and nobody not entirely genocidal would
ever open a door there, the entire world could be sucked through like
opening a black hole or one of the creatures could come through and set
about devouring our universe as they did their own.  

`WThe Wilds`x
The Wilds is a world not unlike how ours must have been a few million years
ago, it is also the home of the wildlings, although they are often found in
the Other as well far more exist in the wilds.  The Wildlings are humans
who live in the Wilds, depending on the location they vary in sophistication
from spear-wielding tribesmen to castle building kings.  The Wilds is also
home to amazing earth-like creatures, both animals that exist today as well
as animals that did exist or present ones grown to a huge size.  It is a
place with wolves the size of houses, mammoths and even dinosaurs.  

`WThe Elemental Planes`x
These are worlds that are made entirely of a particular element, this is a
water plane, a fire plane, a lightning plane and so on.  Far from lifeless
however these planes are filled with creatures made entirely from those
elements, some primitive but some remarkably sophisticated and intelligent.

 `c1`g.`x Do not OOCly discuss or give out IC information that is sensitive and
    current.  Information is current if it has to do with or impacts characters
    currently playing the game.  Information is sensitive if it isn't publicly
    known and isn't trivial.  If it's about something that was being openly
    discussed in public, it's fair game.  If it's trivial to the point where it
    couldn't really affect anything, such as a funny joke someone told, it's
    fine.  If it's about stuff that happened months or years ago to characters
    long since dead, it's okay as well.  If not though, you shouldn't be talking
    about it.  

 `c2`g.`x Do not attempt to OOCly influence other players IC behavior.  Don't, for
    instance, say you should do or you shouldn't do something.  Similarly, do
    not say it would be really cool if you did or didn't do something.

 `c3`g.`x Do not OOCly discuss matters which aren't publicly known aspects of your
    current character.  Don't tell people about his hidden motivations or inner
    personality.  Do not explain the reasons why they did or said anything.  If
    someone mentions that your character seems like a lecher, do not respond
    with 'Well, but really that's just hiding his inner sexual insecurities" or
    anything along those lines.  Once your character has retired or died, feel
    free to explain.  

 `c4`g.`x Do not OOCly script or predetermine events, actions, schemes or roleplay
    with others.  

 `c5`g.`x Do not tell others who the alts, Story Runners, or Immortals of another
    person are or who you think they are unless you know the player is fine with
    it.  

 `c6`g.`x Do not make assertions to others about other players based on speculation or
    hearsay without making some effort to find out if they are true or not.
    This can be done by contacting the player in question or the staff.  

`c 7`g.`x If you speak OOCly with someone more than once a week on average
`x    you should add them to your friend list. See help friend.

`c 8`g.`x Do not respond OOCly to anonymous feedback.

 `c9`g.`x Do not discuss real world politics or religion on public channels.`x

`cCommon Background Exception`g:`x If you want to make a character with someone else
that has a common background, that is permissible.  You can use OOC
communication to set up and discuss the background, but not current events.

`cStory Runner Exception`g:`x You can talk OOCly to SRs about your character's
background and such if it is relevant to a current or future plot.

We feel the reasons for these rules are pretty obvious.  We don't want the IC
environment being dictated by the OOC factors.  We don't want a player's OOC
influence to be more important than his IC influence.  We want people to be able
to play alts or SR without worrying about their actions on one character
affecting peoples attitudes towards the other.  They should also be able to
relax and play a character without worrying about people bugging them to SR
stuff.  We want people to behave decently toward each other and not start or
spread rumors that will detract from another's experience. 

We understand that while we will be unable to enforce these rules in many
situations, players need to be aware that they can be punished for breaking
them.  Opting to follow these rules is in the best interests of each player and
the community as a whole.  They foster respect and goodwill. By typing `Wconsent
OOC rules`x, you will unlock the `Wtell`x command.  Typing it again will disable it.
Refusing to consent to the OOC rules does not make you exempt from them, but the
mechanism ensures that you are aware of the rules prior to using `Wtell`x.

If there is anything about the rules that you don't understand or wish to
discuss, please contact the immortals.  Alterations will be considered as well.

Text `c[`WRationalization and Self-Awareness`c]`x
A person who has been imprinted is never aware that the desires or feelings he has been given are not his own. He will always rationalize why he wants or feels this way and, after the imprint has run its course, why he no longer does.
 
A person who has been imprinted does not act in a way that is robotic or otherwise out of character and it should be extremely difficult for another character to know he has been imprinted even if those characters know one another intimately. The new desires and feelings are integrated into a person's personality so completely that he can rationalize any attempt by others to suggest that he's been manipulated in some way, even against massive evidence. He feels entirely certain that he is still himself and all his desires and feelings are his own.
 
`c[`WConflicting Imprints`c]`x
If a character has two or more imprints that conflict with one another, the resulting RP should make this clear to some extent. If bringing it across in RP isn't feasible or the number of conflicting imprints becomes too great, it is permissible to RP each as being weakened by the resulting confusion along with some general emotional turmoil or something similar such as a serious headache.
 
`c[`WDiscovering Imprints`c]`x
When and after being under the influence of hypnosis or psychic persuasion, a person has no awareness that they are being influenced or that they've been in a trance. If an imprint is accepted the imprinted person has no awareness that they are under another's influence with the exception of 'body' imprints, in which case the character is aware that their own body is moving or behaving in abnormal ways that are outside of their control but not necessarily how or why or who might be responsible.

If an imprint is rejected, the character has no knowledge that any influence was attempted, and certainly no knowledge of what the rejected imprint pressured them to do. External observers may recognize attempts at hypnosis, but not psychic persuasion. While it is acceptable to believe that an acquaintance behaving strangely may be under the influence of mind control, your character should almost never be certain of it and should probably be wrong more often than they are right.

`yTips and Notes`g:`x
`g * `xIf you're on the fence if you should follow an imprint or not, follow it. 
`g * `xIf you think an inhibition or competing desire would stop you following an imprint, ask yourself if that inhibition or competing desire has come out clearly in your roleplay previously. If it hasn't, you're on pretty sketchy ground.  
`g * `xIf you decide not to follow an imprint, it's usually a good idea to at least show through your roleplay that you're thinking about following it or tempted to follow it.  
`g * `xBeing "strong willed" or anything similar is a completely invalid reason for not following an imprint.  
`g * `xHaving been imprinted several times before or being able to do mind control yourself is not a valid reason to be aware of mind control or be more resistant to it.  
`g * `xIf an imprint is something that your character normally wants to do and sometimes does, it's unreasonable to have additional resistance to it.

However, exceptions will be made when roleplay is considered to be abusive.
In these instances, staff may punish places or even work to undo some of the
damage which has been caused by the offender.  Such instances will be
handled on a case by case basis.

`cExamples of Abusive Roleplay could be`g:`x

 `g*`x  Taking any PvP action without a reasonable expectation of survival or due to
    a disregard for that survival.  e.g. Murder suicide

world and used to augment them in various ways.  There are three types,
Charms, Amulets and weapons each comes in two levels of quality.  Anyone can
use an artifact but carrying too many of them causes interference which
stops them from functioning. Most people can only carry one charm and one amulet or weapon
at onece, bur arcanists can carry 1 more for each point in an arcane
focus.

`WActivate (item)`x
-Activates an artifact, costs 2% of your life force to do so.  

`WArtificeweapon (item) (1-2) (discipline)`x

specified offensive discipline.  

`WArtificeamulet (item) (1-2) (discipline)`x

Text A ritual is a type of magic that doesn't require you to be able to see your 
target, but does take a fair bit of time and energy. Characters need at least 
ritualism 1 to be able to perform rituals.  They are also quite time consuming, 
taking generally two hours to complete, although those with the incantation 
stat can reduce this significantly. If a character is attacked, struck or 
pinned while attempting a ritual it will fail and they will have to start again. 
 
`cLife Force Costs per level of Ritualism`g:`W 1: 21%, 2: 12%, 3: 9%, 4: 6%, 5: 4%`x
 
Some rituals are more or less expensive however.  If a character performing
a ritual is taken below 75% life force they may pass out for a time, or if
taken below 60% may even die. The power of the ritual when it strikes is 
determined by the arcane focus of the practitioner and the tier of the target. 
Rituals that finish during the `Wwitching hour`w, `W3AM`w to `W4AM`w, cost less life force.

Text Karma is a game resource mostly used to create higher tier characters and
also to increase your experience or roleplay experience cap.  It is
generally only given out for activities that add to the story of the game
world such as StoryRunning.

Personal Karma is gained just by regular roleplaying, but only 25, 000
personal karma can be used on any individual character, and only 40, 000
over all characters on your account.

Beyond this the only ways to obtain karma are to use a storyrunner,
specifically to run encounters, plots, scheme thwart attempts or scenes in
the wilds.  Or to fill in character feedback surveys, and in some cases,
create operations.

`cSyntax`g: `Wchange archetype `g(`Warchetype`g) (`Wmodifier`g/`Wnone`g)`x

                  `g(`W`Wkarma to spend`w`g)`x

80% of any karma spent will return to your character upon reroll, but only
slowly over time roleplaying.  Earning karma makes it return much quicker.
Only non personal karma spent will return.

Using `gkarma buy focus`x Will give your character an additional focus point.
This costs 15 000 karma for the first point, 30 000 for the second, 45 000
for the third etc. So to buy three extra focus points the total cost would
be 90 000.

Using `gkarma buy origin (stat name)`x Will give your character an additional
origin stat power. This costs 10 000 karma.

Society Leaders and Storyrunners can grant awards to players which increases
their rate of karma gain until they've earned a set amount and can help make
accruing karma easier.  Impressing your Storyrunners with your roleplaying
and impressing your society leaders with your usefulness are the best ways
to obtain these awards.

Enter or exit the nightmare physically  

The nightmare is a psychic realm that exists midway between reality and
dream.

No one can enter the nightmare without a special charm, and seeing into
it requires drinking of mandrake tea. The details of individuals outside
the nightmare and what they're doing cannot be seen from inside it.
Physically leaving the nightmare requires a room with a mirror in it.
Dreaming characters also wander the nightmare as spectres.

When inside the nightmare, characters have a nightmare manifestation, items
or changes in their appearance which are manifested from their psyche.

It is possible to use some of your life force to physically force another
into the nightmare in order to assault them. Most supernatural conflicts
involve this or other methods of psychic conflic.

`WSyntax`x: Nightmare pull (target)
For 5% of your life force this sends a blast through the nightmare to strike
your target and yank them forcefully deep into the nightmare. Starting a
fight immediately. It also causes a ripple at the point of impact, giving
anyone else capable of entering the nightmare a chance to join them.

You can also nightmare pull vehicles, in which case the vehicle tends to
disappear and become lost, only to show up a short time later
in some random location as if parked, and the driver of the vehicle is the
one who takes the full blast of the nightmare pull.  Characters in buildings
protected by nightmare shields cannot generally be forced into the nightmare.
 
Normal humans who are near people who enter or are pulled into the nightmare
often experience a momentary spacing out or deja vu.  
 
You cannot earn influence in the nightmare.

Text Influence is a resource mechanic representing your character's sway with
the general NPC population in the game, and can be used for a number of
social mechanics in-game.  

Influence is mostly earned by roleplaying with other characters.  You will
earn a small amount of influence whenever you roleplay with someone. 
However, most influence is earned by other people roleplaying with you. 
Whenever you're roleplaying with someone and especially when they
specifically target or speak to you you'll earn some influence based on
their social rank, as well as, how much influence they've given out
recently.  In essence, the more important and famous someone is and the more
attention they pay you relative to everyone else, the more influence you
earn.  

Influence can be used to praise or diss someone, to start rumors, to run
schemes or found societies.  It is capped at 100k.  

There are several subtypes of influence that can be earned in other ways,
but each of them have more restricted uses and none of them can be
transferred to other people for the use of schemes.  
 
Society Influence
  Society Influence is gained based on your society standing and can only
  be used for loyalty praises and disses for other people, and not yourself.
  This is capped at 10k.
 
Scheme Influence
  Scheme influence can only be used for running schemes or creating societies. 
  It can be gained by having contact stats whose jobs are set to 'planning' 
  and can be gained once per day. It is capped at 100k. 
  See Also: Help  Contacts
 
Supernatural Influence

Some schemes will never terminate naturally until a thwart has at least been
attempted.  
 
The author name on the scheme can be taken as IC information. Scheme authors are always culpable for their schemes. All schemes are local except for Dominance, Aegis and Cleanse, which are worldwide.
 
The length of time a scheme will run may be reduced if the author, or nominated SRs are not available, and visible/not AFK for thwarts.

Text Fatigue builds up over time as you fight, going up a little when you
attack or move.  When it reaches one hundred you will get penalties to your
disciplines and experience gains.  

Fatigue can be lowered by eating, drinking and roleplaying while you're at
full defense but this will only work up to a certain point.  

After this sleep is required to recover, logging off for several hours will
set your fatigue back to zero.  Fortunately for would be adventurers the
Lodge is enchanted to enhance the recovery of anyone inside it.  Spending
about 20 minutes inside is as good as a solid few hour nap and will lower
fatigue to let people get back to fighting.  

From a RP perspective, the recovery from the Lodge is not quite as good as
real sleep, if people rely on it too much they will grow increasingly
strained and stretched, similar to people who over caffeinate to stay up for
long times.

RESET alone will display the resets in the current room.  The <number>
will be displayed with this list.  Typing ? WEAR-LOC will list possible
locations that an object can be loaded to.  The [<max #>] is the maximum
number of mobiles allowed in this area and will default to 1 if no number
is entered, as the [<max #>] is the maximum allowed in the room, 1 by
default. 
For resets to be successful make sure that you add them in a logical order.
For example if you are equipping a mobile don't load a container in the room
and fill it with some objects and then continue equipping the mobile.  It is
likely that resets will backfire if they are not carefully entered.

Text Introductions allow you to learn the name of a person.  Until you know
someone's name, you will only see their intro description, which many refer
to as short descriptions, or sdescs.  To set your own short description,
simply type `Wintro`w followed by the description you want.  

To remember someone else's name after they have introduced themselves to
you, type `Wremember`w followed by a keyword from their short description
followed by their name.  For example, if you saw 'a hairy middled-aged man'
in the room, and he introduces himself as Huor, you could type `Wremember
hairy huor`w or `Wremember middle huor`w.  Remember that people can lie about
their names.  

If you are a Shifter, a Werewolf, or a Selkie, you can use this command to
change the short descriptions of your different forms.  You do this by
changing into a different form and using the command to write out which
short description you wish.

Text Places are areas placed inside rooms as separate areas to for characters to 
congregate. This is useful for dividing a large area and offering some in-
character privacy, as well as for putting in places to wash.
 
`cSyntax`g:`W look `g(`Wplace keyword`g)`w
 This will give you the description of the place, if any, as well as a list of
 all characters currently at that place.
 
`cSyntax`g:`W join `g(`Wplace keyword`g)`w
 This will join your character to the place in question. Joining a place will
 automatically append the place to your character's roomtitle, unless manually
 set.
 
 Dynamic places can be created by using the join command with the name
 of the place you wish to join. For example, join by the car. In order
 to join a dynamic place which is already created, you must join with
 the full name of the dynamic place.

`cSyntax: `Wjoin`x
 Typing join without an argument will have you leave the place you are in.
 This is not necessary when switching to a new place.

`cSyntax`g:`W decorate place `g(`Wstring`g)`w
 This adds a new place to houses and shops on the Haven grid, if your character
 has permission to edit it.
 
`cSyntax`g:`W myrooms place `g(`Wnumber`g) (`Wstring`g)`w

Text Basics of MobProgramming
	Ever wonder why most muds either seem dead or overcrowded? The answer
is probably partially due to the fact that the mobiles never do anything
but wait to be slaughtered.  Unless someone has gone to great lengths
and added many special procedures, most mobiles have no idea you are in
the room with them and rarely listen to what you say. The typical Midgaard
mayor wanders happily along even when the populace pokes him, waves his
City Key about, unlocks his gates, or frenches his secretary, etc. So a way to
give the mobiles a bit more spirit would be neat. Enter the MOBprograms.

TRIGGERS AND SCRIPTS

	The backbone of the MOBprograms shall be called triggers from this
point on.  Essentially, they are procedure calls placed in sneaky places in
the mud code which provide the context for what is going on around the
mobile.  So, if something happens in the mobile's room and a trigger is
activated, then a list of commands is sent to the interpreter in the
mobile's name, thus making her/it/him do an appropriate something.

VARIABLES

	Since knowing the appropriate response for every mobile to every
possible trigger is not easy, this command list shouldn?t be a rigid script,
but needs to be somehow unique for the mobile and the situation.  However, in
order to know the situation, a mobile needs to know more about the trigger
than that it just happened. So, we have to include some sort of variables
as well to set the context appropriately.

MOBPROGRAMS VS. SPEC_PROCS

	As most implementors know, most area creators are not versed in
coding, but usually have great ideas. Therefore, whatever system is used needs
to be quite simple. This is not to demean creators in anyway. Simply, it is
useless to have a powerful system, if the only person able to write anything
is someone who finds C coding in general to be exciting and non frustrating. 
If that is going to be the case, then stick to the special procedures, since
there is no bound to what a complex special procedure can accomplish. Yet,
from experience working on several muds, most admins and implementers prefer
not to be writing one shot spec_procs to satisfy the needs of their creators.
 
	Thus, the basic idea: let mobiles react to a myriad of mud
events/situations by having them perform a list of commands which can be
tailored to the moment through a simple and unintimidating scheme usable by
any creator.

Argument: string

	The argument is a phrase, a text string. The trigger is activated
whenever the phrase is contained in the	act() message.

NOTE:  	Most general trigger. Applies to almost every event which happens
	in the mud. Anytime the function act() is called with a message
	to be delivered TO_CHAR,TO_VICT,TO_ROOM,etc. the act can be
	triggered.  Basically this will trigger on almost everything

Text Keyword : 'random'
Argument: number

	The argument is a number between 0 and 99 inclusive.

NOTE:  	This trigger is checked at each PULSE_MOBILE and if the argument is
	greater than a percentage roll the trigger is activated. This
	will happen even if there is no PC in the room with the mob,
	but there must be players in the same area. 
	It is useful to give mobiles a bit of a personality. For instance
	a janitor who stops to spit tobacco, or complain about the hours,
	or wonder why there are no woman janitors on muds, or a fido which
	barks or growls or pees on the curb is much more alive than one
	which just sits there scavenging.
	Note that this trigger is checked only when there are players in
	the area. If you want this event to be triggered always, you must
	set the ACT_UPDATE_ALWAYS flag of the mobile.

	IMPORTANT: In an entry program, the mobile can only refer to a

	mobile sees the person leave. Useful for having a single guardian to
	watch several exits. An exit trigger works better than an entry
	trigger, since you can refer to a specific PC instead of a random PC.
	IMPORTANT: If this event is triggered, the victim will not move
	through the exit. If necessary, you must move the character yourself
	in your program (see MOB TRANSFER/MOB GTRANSFER). Also, this event
	is not triggered when a character flees from combat or the mobile
	is not in its default position.

Text Keyword : 'give'
Argument: string or object vnum

	The argument is either the a string containing words to be
	matched against the keywords of the object, or the word "all";
	e.g. argument "long sword" will match to objects "long bow" and
	"small sword".
	Alternatively, the argument can be the virtual number of a single
	object.

NOTE:  	This is triggered whenever something is given to the mobile.  
      Best used for quests.  Since the first successful trigger is the only       one of this type which is processed, having 
an "all" argument in the
	script at the end of the MOBprogram list is essentially a default
	response.

Text Keyword : 'bribe'
Argument: number

	The argument is any positive integer number.

NOTE:  	This trigger is activated whenever money is given to the mobile.
	If the amount given exceeds the number, then process the commands.
	Note again, that an argument of '1' would act as a default response.
	Also note that if the script is not triggered (because of too little
	money having been given), the mobile still keeps the money...

	ROM 2.4 NOTE: Since ROM 2.4 has two different types of currency
	(gold and silver coins), for bribe trigger the amount to be given
	is converted to silver coins with the rate of 1 gold = 100 silver.
	Thus, the number in the argument should be the expected amount in
	silver coins.

	spells (see MOB CAST), curse at the opponent, or whatever. Only the
	first successful one will be processed to save time.  Also, this
	means that the mobile won?t get lucky and 1. curse, cast a fireball

	checks to see if the hit points of the mobile are below the given
	percentage. Multiple hpcnt triggers should be listed in increasing

Text Keyword : 'death'
Argument: number

	The argument is a percent once again.

NOTE:  	When the mobile dies, if the random percentage is less than the
	argument the mobile performs the MOBprogram commands rather than the
	usual death_cry() sequence.  This is done before the corpse is made,
	so the commands can be considered the mobiles last gasp. It could
	perhaps	destroy the items it was holding (see MOB REMOVE and MOB
	JUNK), or create some (see MOB OLOAD), or cast a spell (see MOB
	CAST) on the killer and the room, or even goto a new location (see
	MOB GOTO) and die there (with a text message, the corpse would seem
	to vanish) The position of the mobile is set to STANDING, and so it
	can do all the normal commands, without worrying about being DEAD.
	However, even if the mobile restores itself to full hit points, it
	will still die.
	This is not a way to immortal mobiles. However, the last thing this
	mobile does could be to goto some vacant room, load a fresh version
	of itself, drop all its items, force the new mobile to get all the
	items and wear them, send the new mobile back to the character who
	killed it and force the new mobile to attack that character. Along
	with a text message which said the mobile restored itself, this
	might be a convincing effect. (Note that your kitten could turn into
	a dragon this way too).

NOTE:  	This trigger activates when the delay of a mobile (set with the

	staged mobile behavior, for example, a guardian could see a
	player entering a room, give a warning and activate a delay.
	If the player is still present when the delay expires, the
	guard would attack the player. (See also MOB REMEMBER).
	A mobile can have several delay triggers, but every time the

NOTE:	This trigger activates when the mobile is fighting and the
	opponent issues a "surrender" command. When triggered, both parties
	will cease fighting, and the mobile can accept the surrender
	(perhaps taking all equipment from the character with MOB REMOVE).
	Note that if the mobile does not accept the surrender, it must
	resume fighting with MOB KILL.
	If a character surrenders and the mobile does not have a surrender
	trigger, or the trigger does not activate, the fight resumes
	normally.

NOTE: No MOBprograms will be successful when the mobile is charmed
(since it has no self volition, it should act like it has none) to protect
mobiles which are given special powers from being implemented by a player.

Text MOBCOMMANDS

	MOBcommands are special commands that allow mobiles to perform
immortal-like actions within a MOBprogram (transferring players or loading
items, for example). Most MOBcommands them are wiz commands which have been
changed to allow for mobiles to perform the commands. In this version of
MOBprograms, players have been prevented from using these commands by adding
a separate interpreter for MOBcommands. This also speeds up (in most cases)
MOBprogram execution when MOBcommands are used. All MOBcommands are
preceded with the word 'MOB' on the command line.


Syntax:  MOB ASOUND [string]
	 MOB ZECHO  [string]
	 MOB GECHO  [string]

	ASOUND prints the text string to the rooms around the mobile in the
	same manner as a death cry. This is really useful for powerful
	aggressive and is also nice for wandering minstrels or mobiles like
	that in concept.
	ZECHO prints the string to all players in the same area with the
	mobile. GECHO prints the string to all players in the game.

Syntax:  MOB ECHO                 [string]
	 MOB ECHOAT      [victim] [string]
	 MOB ECHOAROUND  [victim] [string]

	ECHO displays the string to everyone in the room. ECHOAT displays
	the string to the victim only. ECHOAROUND displays the string to
	everyone except the victim.
	The three options let you tailor the message to goto victims or to do
	things sneaky like having a merchant do: 
	mob at guard mob echoat guard rescue_please 
	This coupled with a guard act trigger on rescue_please to:
	mob goto $n
	mob echo $I has arrived.
	It is an effective way of quickly bringing guards to the scene of
	an attack. (Note that the merchant has to be the only one of its
	kind in the game or have a unique name, otherwise the guard might
	go to different mobile...).
	

Syntax:  MOB MLOAD [vnum]
	 MOB OLOAD [vnum] [level] {'room'|'wear'}

        MLOAD creates a mobile and places it in the same room with the
	mobile.
	OLOAD loads the object into the inventory of the mobile. Even if the
	item is non-takable, the mobile will receive it in the inventory.
	This lets a mobile distribute a quest item or load a key or something.
	The optional 3rd parameter can be specified; 'room' means to load
	the object to the room, 'wear' means to force the mobile to wear
	the object loaded (useful for equipping mobiles on the fly).

Syntax:  MOB KILL [victim]

	Lets a mobile kill a player without having to murder. Lots of
	MOBprograms end up with mpkill $n commands floating around. It
	works on both mobiles and players.

Syntax:  MOB FLEE

	Causes a mobile to unconditionally flee from combat. Can be used
	for example with the hit point percentage trigger to simulate
	"wimpy" behavior.

Syntax:  MOB REMOVE [victim] [vnum|'all']

	Lets the mobile to strip an object of given vnum from the victim.
	Objects removed are destroyed. If the vnum is replaced with "all",
	the whole inventory of the victim is destroyed. This command is
	probably most useful for extracting quest items from a player
	after a quest has been completed.


Syntax:  MOB JUNK [object]

	Destroys the object referred to in the mobile's inventory. It prints
	no message to the world and you can do things like junk all.bread or
	junk all. This is nice for having janitor mobiles clean out their
	inventory if they are carrying too much (have a MOBprogram trigger on
	the 'full inventory')

Syntax:  MOB PURGE [argument]

	Destroys the argument from the room of the mobile. Without an argument
	the result is the cleansing of all NPC's and items from the room with
	the exception of the mobile itself.  However, mppurge $i will indeed
	purge the mobile, but it MUST be the last command the mobile tries to
	do, otherwise the mud cant reference the acting mobile trying to do the
	commands and bad things happen.  

Syntax:  MOB AT [location] [command]

	Performs the command at the designated location. Very useful for doing
	magic sleight of hand tricks that leave players dumbfounded.. such as
	metamorphing mobiles, or guard summoning, or corpse vanishing.

Syntax:  MOB GOTO [location]

	Moves the mobile to the room or mobile or object requested. It makes
	no message of its departure or of its entrance, so these must be
	supplied with echo commands if they are desired.

Syntax:  MOB TRANSFER  [victim|'all'] [location]
	 MOB GTRANSFER [victim]       [location]
	 MOB OTRANSFER [object]       [location]

	Sends the victim to the destination or to the room of the mobile as a
	default.  if the victim is "all" then all the characters in the room
	of the mobile are transferred to the destination.  Good for starting
	quests or things like that.  There is no message given to the player
	that it has been transferred and the player doesn?t do a look at the
	new room unless the mob forces them to.
	Gtransfer works like transfer, except that the group the victim
	belongs	to is transferred with the victim. Otransfer transfers an
	object in the room.

Syntax:  MOB FORCE  [victim|'all'] [command]
	 MOB GFORCE [victim]       [command]
	 MOB VFORCE [vnum]         [command]

	Forces the victim to do the designated command. The victim is not told
	that they are forced, they just do the command so usually some mpecho
	message is nice.  You can force players to remove belongings and give
	them to you, etc.  The player sees the normal command messages (such as
	removing the item and giving it away in the above example)  Again, if
	the victim is "all" then everyone in the mobiles room does the command.
	Gforce works like force except that it affects the group the victim
	belongs to.
	Vforce affects all mobiles with given vnum in the game world. This
	is useful for, for example, purging certain type of NPCs from the
	game (by forcing them to purge themselves).

Syntax:  MOB CAST [spell] [victim]

	Lets the mobile to cast spells. Beware, this does only crude validity
	checking and does not use up any mana. All spells are available
	regardless of the race or other abilities of the mobile. Casting the
	spell occurs silently, but spell effects are displayed normally.

Syntax:  MOB DAMAGE [victim|'all'] [min] [max] {lethal}

	Causes unconditional damage to the victim. Specifying "all" as
	victim causes damage to all characters in the room except the mobile.
	Min and max parameters define the minimum and maximum amounts of
	damage caused. By default, the damage is non-lethal, but by supplying
	the optional 'lethal' parameter, the damage can kill the victim.
	This command is silent, you must echo all messages yourself in the
	program. Useful for implementing special attacks for mobiles.

Syntax:  MOB DELAY
	 MOB CANCEL

	MOB DELAY sets the time in PULSE_MOBILE after which the mobile's
	delay trigger is activated. If the mobile has a program defined
	for delay trigger, the program is executed when the timer expires.
	MOB CANCEL resets the delay timer.


Syntax:  MOB REMEMBER [victim]
	 MOB FORGET

	This command enables the mobile to remember a player for future
	reference in a MOBprogram. The player can subsequently be referred
	as '$q' in programs activated by the mobile. MOB FORGET clears
	the target. Note that if the first time the mobile runs a program,
	$q is automatically set to the player who triggered the event.
	Most commonly this command is used in delayed programs, where the
	mobile has to remember the player who triggered the original
	event, for example to continue conversation.

Syntax:  MOB CALL [vnum] {victim} {target1} {target2}

	This command lets you call MOBprograms from within a running one,
	i.e. to call a MOBprogram subroutine. The first parameter is the
	vnum of the program to execute, the second is the victim's name
	(for example $n), and the third and fourth are optional object
	names. All other parameters except vnum can be replaced with
	word 'null' indicating ignored parameter.
	MOBprograms can be called recursively, but as a safety measure,
	parser allows only 5 recursions.

Text The provided list of if_checks and their arguments are below.  They
should all be fairly obvious in what they do, but some of the more obtuse
deserve a slight explanation. Any '==' operator can be replaced with any of
the available ones described above.  The argument $* refers to any of the
variables which make sense for that if_check (i.e. for an if_check which is
referencing a person the only valid variables would be $i, $n, $t, $r or $q)

Text To make things come alive, variables are needed.  These are
represented in the MOBprograms by using a dollar sign convention as in the
socials. When the mud command is processed, these variables are expanded into
the values shown below. Usually, it is best to use the short descriptions
of mobiles and the names of players when speaking them, but if you are
performing an action to someone almost always you want the name. The
title field for players is an extra that probably won?t often be used.
Without further hesitation... the variables:

$i	the first of the names of the mobile itself.
$I	the short description of the mobile itself.
$n	the name of whomever caused the trigger to happen.
$N	the name and title of whomever caused the trigger to happen.
$t	the name of a secondary character target (i.e. A smiles at B)
$T	the short description, or name and title of target (NPC vs PC)
$r	the name of a random PC in the room with the mobile
$R	the short description, or name and title of the random PC
$q	the name of the MOBprogram target (see MOB REMEMBER)
$Q	the short description of the MOBprogram target

$j	he,she,it based on sex of $i.
$e	he,she,it based on sex of $n.
$E	he,she,it based on sex of $t.
$J	he,she,it based on sex of $r.

$k	him,her,it based on sex of $i.
$m	him,her,it based on sex of $n.
$M	him,her,it based on sex of $t.
$K	him,her,it based on sex of $r.

$l	his,hers,its based on sex of $i.
$s	his,hers,its based on sex of $n.
$S	his,hers,its based on sex of $t.
$L	his,hers,its based on sex of $r.

$o	the first of the names of the primary object (i.e. A drops B)
$O	the short description of the primary object
$p	the first of the names of the secondary object (i.e A puts B in C)
$P	the short description of the secondary object

	Also, in if_checks, the accepted variables are the basic ones
(i,n,t,r,o,p,q).  If a variable is referenced that doesn?t exist, then the
value is simply left blank or replaced with "someone"/"something" in
output (i.e. referring to $o when the trigger is: A kisses B)

	If variable $q has not been defined, it is automatically set to the
last player that has triggered the program being executed (i.e. variable $n).
Once $q has been defined, it can be modified with MOB REMEMBER and MOB
FORGET commands in a program. Variable $q lets the mobile "remember" a player
across different programs, which can be useful. Note that $q is set
automatically only the FIRST TIME the mobile executes a program, every time
thereafter it must be set with MOB REMEMBER.

	The only problem with the variables is that the secondary object and
the secondary target are passed by act() in the same location.  This means that
if you reference $t in an  A puts B in C  situation, the result will probably
be a happy mud crash or some weird side effect, especially if $t is used in
an if_check (i.e. if isnpc($t) in the above situation) The basic fix for this
is to change everyone who calls the act() procedure to specify a secondary
object and a secondary character. But that is a fairly comprehensive trivial
twiddle, so we left it the way it is so that, you aren?t forced to make all 
those twiddles to use the MOBprograms.

Text In place of any legal mud command in a MOBprogram, one can substitute a
flow of control command. Here is the syntax for a flow of control command.
The parts between [ and ] are optional.

"if" " " {if_check_1} {argument} [ {operator} {value} ] NL
[ "or" " " {if_check_2} {argument} [ {operator} {value} ] NL ]
[ "or" " " {if_check_N} {argument} [ {operator} {value} ] NL ]
                        .           .           .
[ "and" " " {if_check_N} {argument} [ {operator} {value} ] NL ]
[ "and" " " {if_check_N} {argument} [ {operator} {value} ] NL ]
			.	    .		.

	[ {program_command_1} NL ]
	[ {program_command_2} NL ]
	      .   .   .
	[ "break" NL ]
	      .   .   .
	[ {program_command_N} NL ]

[ "else" NL ]

	[ {program_command_1} NL ]
	[ {program_command_2} NL ]
	      .   .   .
	[ "break" NL ]
	      .   .   .
	[ {program_command_N} NL ]

"endif" NL

	Basically, it is: an 'if' line, followed by zero or more 'or' lines,
followed by zero of more 'and' lines ('and' and 'or' lines can be in any order)
followed by zero or more legal mud commands, which may contain a 'break' line,
possibly followed by an 'else' line , followed by zero or more legal mud
commands, which may contain a 'break' line, followed by an 'endif' line.

The only new syntax labels are all in the IF/OR/AND line:

--Explanations

An IF_CHECK is a string which describes under what context to compare things.
The ARGUMENT is the reference point from which the LHS of an expression comes.
The OPERATOR indicates how the LHS and RHS are going to be compared.
The VALUE is the RHS of the expression to be compared by the operator.

The BREAK command bails out of the entire MOBprogram regardless of the
level if nesting. (END is a synonym for BREAK).

      slap $n
      shout MOMMY!!! $N is poking me.
   endif
endif


Ok.. time to translate.. the trigger will only happen when the mobile
gets the message "... pokes you in the ..." If the offender (recall
the $n and $N refer to the char who did the poking...) is an NPC, then
the mobile merely chuckles and pokes back. If the offender was a PC
then good and low level characters get a warning, high level chars
get attacked, and midlevel chars get slapped and whined at.
Also, when attacking, the mobile will check if there are guards in the
room (if mobhere guard) and if one is found, it will be forced to
attack the player, too (mob force guard mob kill $n). Notice the
use of a MOBcommand "mob force".

Note that two of these mobiles could easily get into an infinite poke
war which slows down (or frequently crashes) the mud just a bit :( 
Be very careful about things like that if you can. (i.e. don?t respond 
to a poke with a poke, and try not to let heavily programmed robot mobiles
wander around together. More on that is given above.)

Also, it is clear that the 'order' command could get confused with the 'or'
control flow. However, this is only the case when 'order' is abbreviated to
its two letter form, and placed immediately following an 'if' line. Thus,
if you want to be that malicious in trying to break the MOBprogram code,
no one is going to stand in your way (However, the result of this would be
a bug message and a bail out from the ifcheck so things don?t really break)

Another example:

This program could be used on a temple guardian mobile, whose job is to
prevent evil characters from entering the sanctuary. Let's assume
the exit to the temple is north (exit 0) and the temple antechamber is
room 2301

sedit new            <social>
sedit show           <social>
sedit <string-name>  <social> [string]

SEDIT allows online creation, deletion and editing of socials.

SEDIT DELETE <social> deletes that social. The deletion is irrecoverable,
save for restoring a backup file, so use this command with great care!

SEDIT NEW <social> creates a new, empty social.

SEDIT SHOW <social> shows all of the strings for that social.

SEDIT <string-name> <social> [string] changes a certain of the 7 strings
that
make up a social. If you leave out the string, no message will be sent to
the involved characters.

There are 7 strings that make up a social:

cnoarg: Sent to character when no argument typed. E.g. X types HUG and
sees:

Hug whom?

onoarg: Sent to others in the room when no argument is given. In the case
of
HUG, it is an empty string, so that nothing is shown if a player types HUG
by itself.

cfound: Sent to the character if a target is found. E.g. X types HUG Y:

You hug Y.

vfound: Sent to the victim. E.g. X types HUG Y, and Y sees:

X hugs you.

ofound: Sent to others in room, if target is found. E.g. X types HUG Y.
Everyone but X and Y see:

X hugs Y.

cself: Sent to the character if she uses the social on herself. E.g. X
types
HUG X :

You hug yourself.

oself: Sent to others in room when a player uses a social on herself:

X hugs herself in a vain attempt to get friendship.

To get the player names and sexes correct, you need to use those macros:

$n - name of player
$e - he, she or it, depending on sex of player
$m - him, her or it, depending on sex of player
$s - his, her or its, depending on sex of player.

For the victim, just use the uppercase version. E.g. $N is the name of the
victim, $E is he, she or it depending on victim's sex etc.


So, to make a new social called 'epoke' which would poke eyes out, you
would
do the following:

SEDIT NEW epoke
SEDIT cnoarg epoke Poke whose eyes out? (message sent to player)
SEDIT cfound epoke You poke $N's eyes out!
SEDIT vfound epoke $n pokes your eyes out! Ouch..
SEDIT ofound epoke $n pokes $N's eyes out!
SEDIT cself  epoke Being bored, you poke your own eyes out.
SEDIT oself  epoke $n pokes $s eyes out!

To get more examples, type SEDIT SHOW <social-name> to see one of the
existing socials.

The socials are stored in a file called socials.txt. Manual editing of
that file is not advised. A frequent back-up is recommended. The social
file is updated by the server as soon as anything changes.

Text There are two types of combat in Haven; fast combat and emote combat. 
Fast combat is what is normally used when NPCs are involved in the fight,
such as typically when leveling up in the forest.  During fast combat you
can attack and/or move every 12 seconds, each one being on a separate timer.
Attacks are normally made with either a default message, or with a custom
pre-written message.  

Emote combat is normally used when PCs are fighting each other.  During
emote combat characters take it in turns to pick where they want to move and
how they want to attack, they then write an emote, when the emote is
finished and sent the relevant attacks and moves are performed.  Emote
combat is started by a player typing 'attack' by itself.  

Both combat types use the exact same values and calculations.  Disciplines
are used primarily for combat and are improved with experience gained by
using them.  There are three types of discipline, ranged, melee and
defensive.  Ranged disciplines all have different ranges, and will do
maximum damage at half that range, dropping off to 0 at above max range and
0 at melee range.  Melee disciplines always do max damage if at melee range,
but otherwise can't hit.  

Each Discipline does its value in damage ordinarily, unless affected by
range or other affects.  Defensive disciplines provide 5 times their value
in defense.  

Once all your defense is gone, attacks will cause you to suffer wounds,
wounds can take a long time to heal and if severe enough might cause you to
die without hospital care.  

Characters can move a base of 10 per turn in any direction, they can also
`Wcharge`w directly at someone, doubling how far they can move.  

The most basic way to attack is simply `Wattack `g(`Wtarget`g)`w, picking a default
discipline, or `Wattack `g(`Wtarget`g) (`Wdiscipline`g) `wto choose your own discipline,
lastly `Wattack `g(`Wtarget`g) (`Wcustomname`g)`w to use a custom attack.  

To move you simply type `Wmove `g(`Wperson`g) `Waway`w/`Wcharge`w/`g(`Wdistance as a number to
move towards them`g)`w.  You can also use `Wmove `g(`Wxcoord`g) (`Wycoord`g)`w, `Wmove flee `wor
the cardinal direction commands.  

Custom attacks can be set up with the '`Wmake attack`w' command, and have a
name, discipline, a string for how they look like as well as an optional
special flag.  Special flags allow you to attach effects to attacks.  

You can also type `Wmap`w to see a visual representation of the battlefield.

Text Fast combat occurs any time there are NPCs involved in the fight except when;
the NPCs are controlled by a SR, or when the NPCs are the minions of a PC.

In fast combat each time you use the attack command it creates a 12 second
delay before you can use it again, attempting to do so will put the command
into a buffer, where it will then automatically be used when the timer expires.

Move is on its own 12 second timer which works in the same way with its own
buffer.
 
You can type autofire, to set a toggle which will make you
automatically repeat your last attack when available as long as it
was successful.

Text Emote combat occurs when there are no NPCs involved in a fight who aren't
either controlled by a SR, or the minions of a PC.

Emote combat is started by someone typing 'attack' by itself.

The turn in which participants will be allowed to act is randomized, but also
affected by the Fast Reflexes skill, those with higher fast reflexes being more
likely to get to act earlier in the rotation.

When it is your turn you will have two minutes to input your attacks and moves
or you forfeit your turn, this is done just like in fast combat with the attack
and move commands. You can still use attacks with the custom argument to attach
special affects to your attacks, but you won't use the message associated with
that attack.

Once you have input your commands you have five minutes to write an emote to
describe what your character is doing in that turn, how they are moving and
attacking. This is done with the emote command just like in regular RP. Once the
emote is finished and sent the code will be processed and it will move to the
next person's turn.

Text When used outside of combat the attack command will start a fight, in
fast combat all people will then be able to start moving or attacking as
they wish, in an emote fight it will generate a turn order and start to work
through them.  

Typing `Wattack skip`w will skip your turn in emote combat, in fast combat it
won't have any real affect except that if all participants in a fight type
`Wattack skip`w the fight will end.  

Possible syntaxes for attack are:

`WAttack `g(`Wperson`g)`w

When the command is used like this on a target in melee range it will pick
your highest melee discipline to use, when used on a target at range it will
pick the highest ranged discipline to use.  Note the highest ranged
discipline might not always be the most effective discipline to use
depending on the range of the target.  


`WAttack `g(`Wperson`g) (`Wdiscipline`g)`w

This syntax allows you to pick the discipline you'd like to use for the
attack.  


`WAttack `g(`Wperson`g) (`Wcustomname`g)`w

This syntax allows you to use a custom attack, in fast combat your attack
will use the message you've written for this attack instead of the default
message.  In both fast combat and emote combat it will attach any special
affect you've set up on that custom to the attack.  

`g(`WCustomname`g) (`Wperson`g)`w is an alternate syntax for using custom attacks.  


`WAttack `g(`Wperson`g) `Wknockout`w

Used in melee range on someone who has run out of defense to knock them out
to be captured.  


`WAttack defend`w

Skip your chance to attack to instead take 66% damage until your next turn
to attack.  

You can also use `Wtackle `g(`Wtarget`g) `wto move your character instantly up to two
rooms towards the target and immediately start a fight.

Keyword Move~

Text The move command is used to move around on the battlefield, your normal
move range is 10 plus twice your skill at running.  This is doubled when
doing a charge to 20 plus four times your skill at running.  The skill
superjump allows you to move towards a target at three times your normal
speed.  

To `Wmove`w towards someone you can use the syntaxes:

`WMove `g(`Wperson`g) (`Wdistance`g)`w/`Wcharge`w/`Wjump`w

To move away from someone you can use the syntaxes:

`WMove `g(`Wperson`g) `Waway`w/`Wretreat

`wTo move towards a set of coordinates you can use the syntax:

`WMove `g(`Wx coordinate`g) (`Wy coordinate`g)`w

You can also use a cardinal direction command, such as `Weast `wor `Wnorth`w to move
in that direction.  

`wYou can protect someone with `Wmove `g(`Wperson`g) `Wprotect`w.  This will move you
towards them and if you get next to them all attacks directed against them
will hit you instead.  

`WMove Up/Down`x will move you into the room above or below the room you are
currently in, if you are able to do so.  

`WMove Sprint/Flee`x Will move you in the direction you're already facing, if
you haven't yet used an attack that round it will consume the attack and
move you at triple speed. When used with flee will also attempt to end
the fight like attack skip. Wounded characters flee much slower.

You can also use the commands in the form of `WCharge (person)`x or `WRetreat
(person)`x Or `WFlee`x 

The bonus from all fast movement types is reduced by carrying armor, shield
and large weapons. This particularly strongly effects sprinting/fleeing.
Retreat and protect movement keeps you facing in the same direction, otherwise
you will turn to face the direction you are moving.

Text There are three types of wounds in Haven, mild, severe, and critical. 
When you are struck by damage that exceeds your defenses you will incur a
mild wound, the next time you will incur a severe wound, then critical, if
hit again you will die.  Wounds heal whether you are online or offline, but
some only if you are in a hospital.  

NPCS only have one wound state, severe.  The first time damage exceeds their
defense they become severely wounded, the second time they die.  

Mild wounds will heal regardless of where you are, and will take about a day
to do so.

Severe wounds will only heal in a hospital or medical center unless you have
regenerative abilities while offline, but will heal outside when online. 
They will take about three and a half days to heal.  

Critical wounds will only heal in a hospital or medical center unless you
are a vampire and will take about 3 hours to do so.  If you do not get to a
hospital in time, or leave a hospital for too long before your critical
wounds are treated, and you're not a vampire, you will die.  You have about
1 hour to get a critically wounded person to a hospital or medical center
before they die.  

Each wound when it heals downgrades to the lower version, so if you are
critically wounded after a day in the hospital you'll be severely wounded,
after another four days in the hospital you'll be mildly wounded, after a
further day in or out of the hospital you'll be completely healthy again.  

Vampires can't get critically wounded, critical wounds for them are the same
as severe for other people.  

Regeneration 1 will make mild wounds heal in about 2 hours, Regeneration 2
will make them heal in about 30 minutes.  

Regeneration 1 will make severe wounds heal in about a day, Regeneration 2
will make them heal in about 4 hours.  

Regeneration has no affect on critical wounds.

ones are combat experience, roleplay experience and karma.  

Regular combat experience is earned every time you engage in combat, this
experience is used to increase your disciplines, which govern your
characters attack damages and defenses.  

Roleplay experience is gained by roleplaying with other players.  It's used
to buy stats and powers which cover almost everything else about your
character.  

Karma is gained by doing things that add to the game's story such as running
adventures, it's used to unlock access to higher tier characters as well as

into the deep forest and find monsters to battle, but this can also be very
dangerous.  Sparring with other players offers a safer way to earn combat
experience, but there's a daily cap on how much can be gained this way.  You
can also convert influence into combat experience if you have excess,
although the rate isn't that high.  Lastly you can go on adventures and
convert your adventure experience into combat experience.

Text Haven is a game where almost anything can be made to look how you
want it to look, from the clothing and items your character uses
to the rooms they go to, and the way they fight.

The describe command is used to write about how your character looks,
you can describe each individual part of your character separately and
they will show up when exposed by your clothing.

The history command puts you into an editor where you can write your
character's back-story.

The charnotes command puts you into an editor where you can add notes
for SRs to your character.

Your attacks can be customized with the custom command, this allows you
to set up the message as seen by you, your target, and everyone else in
the room as well as setting the discipline the attack uses and any attached
special effects.

The customize command is used to edit created objects, it can be used to
change how an item looks as well as where it covers or is worn for clothing
and how it tastes for food or drink.

The myroom command is used to list rooms you've created and to edit their
descriptions as well as who has access.

The title command is used to set your OOC title as seen on the wholist.

The roomtitle command is used to set a string that appears after your name
when people see you in the room.

The intro command is used to set the short string you appear by before people
remember you. When used in another form it edits the intros for those forms.

The outfit command is used to set up your characters different sets of clothes.

remembered, for example.  A tall man with black hair and blue eyes.  When
writing an intro it is a good idea to be a little distinctive with it, also
to avoid judgments or personality characteristics.  

When used in another form such as wolf or wolfman it sets the intro for that
form.  

The describe command is used to set what people see when they look at your
character with the look command.  

`WSyntax:`x describe <location> Valid locations: self, hands, lowerarms,
upperarms, feet, lowerlegs, thighs, groin, arse, lowerback, upperback,
lowerchest, breasts, upperchest, neck, lowerface, forehead, hair, eyes,
smell, taste, wolf, wolfman, animal.

`WSyntax:`x describe order <location> number
This syntax allows you to set the order in which your described
elements appear.

Descs are displayed together without spaces or new lines unless you enter
them, individual parts of the desc will disappear when that part of your
body is concealed.  You should not use .  F when making a description, nor
insert line breaks unless you're sure you want them.  Descriptions will wrap
automatically.  
 
You can also use the `Wdetail`x command to add more information to your
character only seen when you look at or are shown certain bodyparts.
See help detail for more information.
 
You can use the change command with eyecolor, haircolor or hairdye
to set your character's genetic eye and hair color, as well as the

Text Roleplaying is the art of being someone else, of creating and embodying
a fictional character. Roleplaying is mandatory on Haven, your character
must act like they are a real person at all times and not someone's game
avatar. The exception to this is a few OOC channels.

Emote allows your character to do describe what your character is doing
at any given time. Used like emote does a dance. Would show up as (your
character name) does a dance. To everyone else in the room. Additional
functionality for the emote command can be found under help emoting.

Say is used for when your character just wants to talk, although you can
mix your conversation into an emote, this saves a lot of time and allows
conversations to flow quicker and easier.

Whisper can be used to convey a private message to someone, used like
whisper to <person> <message>

Socials are pre-written emotes for doing very common things, they cover
things such as nodding or smiling and are a little quicker and easier to
use than emotes.

Text `cSyntax`g:`W emote `g(`Wstring`g)`w
 This is the basic emoting syntax. Unless otherwise specificied, the emote 
 will start with your short desc or whatever others have you remembered by. 
 There is a character limit, but it is fairly long. If you are used to emoting 
 in very long paragraphs, split them up with separate emotes. 
 
`cSyntax`g:`W subtle `g(`Wstring`g)`w
 A subtle emote is the same as a regular emote, except that it can only be
 seen by someone who has joined the same place as you. If you have not
 joined a place, a subtle emote will show to anyone who similarly has not.
 Places will be marked as such in a room description.
 
`cSyntax`g:`W private `g(`Wperson`g)`w `g(`Wstring`g)`w
 A private emote is a regular emote that can only be seen by the person you 
 send it to. You cannot use dialogue in a private emote. A private emote that
 has not been properly targeted will show as a subtle emote.
 
`cSyntax`g:`W announce `g(`Wmessage`g)`x
`x This is a form of emote that goes to everyone in the room
`x even when the room is crowded. Regular emotes do not go to
`x the whole room in crowded rooms but only to those at the
`x same place as you.

`cSyntax`g:`W internal `g(`Wmessage`g)`x
`x This form of emote can only be seen by you and any SRs and allows
`x you to emote internal thoughts, feelings, memories etc.

`cTargeting`g:`w
 
 `W@me`g:`w     @me in an emote will force the emote not to start with your sdesc,
          instead putting it wherever you place it in the paragraph. E.g.,
          emote "Hello," @me says, giving a wave.
          will read as:
          "Hello," Bob says, giving a wave.
          as opposed to:
          emote waves and says, "Hello."
          Bob waves and says, "Hello."
  
 `W@my`g:`w     In order to have your sdesc appear possessive and force the emote
          to not start with it, you must use @my. E.g.,
          emote Stalking down the street, @my eyes peer owlishly around.
          will read as:
          Stalking down the street, Bob's eyes peer owlishly around.
  
 `W@name`g:`w   In order to target someone else in an emote, simply @theirname
          or @introkeyword. E.g.,
          emote glances curiously at @name.
          will read as:
          Bob glances curiously at Alice.
 
 `W@name's`g:`w In order to target someone with a possessive, do the above but add
          a 's as @theirname's. E.g.,
          emote grabs at @name's bag.
          will read as:

Text Good roleplaying is an art, it can take years to master and some people
never seem to be able to get a good grip on it.  Mostly it's similar to
writing fiction, the big differences are that you're writing in real time
with no chance to edit, and that you're writing for the other authors.  

It's impossible to learn how to RP very well from just one guide, it is an
endless pursuit, and you can be sure that the best RPers get to be that way
because they are constantly working on and refining their art.  Those that
feel their RP is already 'good enough' are doomed to never improve beyond
the mediocre.  

Good roleplaying breaks down to two areas, good characterization and good RP
writing.  

RP writing is the art of using says, emotes, descriptions etc to convey what
your character is doing.  This is almost exactly the same as the qualities
of what makes a good fiction writer with one exception.  In a story it's
perfectly ok even considered normal to describe your characters emotions and
thoughts, in RP it often isn't.  Although there's some debate on the issue
the difference comes about because when writing a novel you want people to
identify with your character, when RPing you want to identify with your
character, other people identify with theirs.  

The other reason for this is that few people are perfect at keeping IC and
OOC knowledge separate, it's very common for someone to react differently if
you emote that you fancy them, even though their character shouldn't know
that and therefore shouldn't act any differently.  

Generally it's better to follow the same rule that teachers of fiction
writing beat their students over the head with 'show don't tell.  ' Don't
tell people what your character is thinking or feeling, show them.  Use your
emotes and the way they speak to convey that they fancy that person or
dislike this person.  

The other keys to good RP writing are:

Write something that's easy to read and flows nicely, paying attention to
spelling and grammar etc as much as possible.  Include all relevant details,
the devil is in the details as they say and a few words to describe the way
in which someone does something can add a lot to the RP.  

Brevity, good writing isn't longer than it has to be, the shorter your
emotes and says the less work you're requiring your reader to do.  Any
reader would prefer a 200 page book, to a 500 page book with all the same
stuff in it but 300 more pages of furniture descriptions.  

Speed, people don't like waiting around longer than they have to, the
quicker you can RP the more RP they're getting for their time.  Language,
just like in fiction writing the use of certain words or phrases are much
more likely to strike a chord in people and get your meaning across than
others.  Try to use words and phrases that create vivid imagery and convey
things strongly without being overly flowery or convoluted.  

Some of these do work a little at cross purposes, trying to include detail
and spell check your RP while also trying to be quick and brief is a
challenge, each person needs to strike their own balance of what works for
them.  

The only way to really improve your RP writing is with practice, get out
there and RP and learn from others as well as seek out positive and negative
criticisms.  If most people think your emotes are too long and needlessly
wordy maybe think about working on making them shorter.  Ultimately it is up
to you, but the other players are your readers, if they don't want to read
your work, what is the point?  

Good characterization is the other half to good RP.  It refers to being able
to create a character who's interesting and realistic.  

Creating an interesting character is really about creating a character
that's good for the story, you might be able to make an extremely realistic
tax clerk character but nobody is going to care about him.  An interesting
character is measured by their ability to create RP and their ability to
join to and add to the RP of others.  

It's important to note that RP is a collaborative effort, your character can
never be the star they are one member of an ensemble cast.  Sometimes the
storyline might thrust you center stage but other times it might thrust
someone else.  People get very sick very quickly of playing with someone who
tries to make all RP be about them.  

A good and very common example of this is characters with traumatic
pasts/lives.  When a character goes through something traumatic in game,
this naturally pushes them more center stage, with a lot of the RP revolving
around the sympathy they get, possibly plans for revenge or ways to help
them deal with it.  Every other character around who has a more traumatic
past steals from this attention, nobody else can ever get sympathy because
what they went through is so much worse.  

This doesn't mean you can't have traumatic incidents in your character's
past, but it's very important for you to think about other people when you
make your character, how your character can add to RP that isn't about them,
and if they're likely to detract from that RP maybe you need to re-evaluate
them.  

Being a good side character is about both adding constructive and
destructively to RP.  A character who's always nice all the time is boring,
a character who's always a jerk similarly.  Interesting character conflicts
and situations arise from those characters who sometimes are supportive and
sometimes cause conflict.  If your character can do both of these, and avoid
any spotlight stealing, then you probably have a really good side character.


Being a good main character is mostly about not being selfish.  If the
bounty hunters are after you, yes that might be your problem but if your
character is really set on dealing with it all on their own it gives nobody
else anything to do.  When you find yourself in the spotlight is when it's
more important to be gracious, involve other people in the story in
important ways.  In return they're more likely to do the same to you when
it's their turn.  

Sometimes RP isn't really about you or someone else mostly, but communal. 
This often happens in social RP for instance.  What makes a good communal
character is mostly the same things that make a good side or main character.
Don't spotlight steal, get other people involved, add to the RP in
interesting and not always predictable ways.  Adding to the RP is important,
you might think it's cool to be gruff and silent, but nobody is going to
want to play with you much.  

The other thing that makes a really great interesting character is the
ability to make RP happen in the first place!  A character with reasons to
RP with a lot of people, get them involved in things, make various other
types of RP happen is crucial to a fun game.  Examples might be characters
who throw parties, a journalist who seeks out lots of other PCs to interview
etc.  

If you have a character who has the qualities of both a good main character,
a good side character, a good communal character, and creates RP then you
have a really good interesting character!  

The other half of the battle is realism.  

Realism is very important and often overlooked, it doesn't matter if your
character is a vampire or sorcerer.  Stories must have internal validity,
they must be believable within that world, even if they're fantasy stories,
some would say especially if they are.  The second your character starts
feeling fake and not like a real person people will stop caring about them,
and it's very hard to get them to again.  Very good realistic characters can
make people in real life cry when they're hurt, cheer when they're
triumphant and swoon when they kiss, and that's what you should be aiming
for.  

Making a realistic character can be very hard, there's a lot of different
opinions on the ways to go about it.  A lot of people like to model
characters on themselves or people they know very well, and this is
generally a solid and reliable way to make your character quite realistic. 
The old writer's adage of 'write what you know'.  Unfortunately it's often
the case that you want to play something quite different from yourself or
anybody you know.  In these situations information is your friend, spend a
little time on the internet researching the areas you want to look at and
the people you're trying to emulate.  

The more you learn the better your character is likely to be, but for most
characters a few pages of Wikipedia is probably sufficient.  This does refer
to all areas of your character, lots of people are good at doing a bit of
research if they want their character to be say a doctor.  But it's a lot
rarer to see people do research before involving a character in a same sex
relationship or making a model or musician.  

So that's characterization, it's also largely about practice, taking criticism
and learning from others, but it's also very much about putting the work in
before you make the character and about really being able to take a step
back and thinking about the other players, who are your audience, and how
you can deliver a realistic and interesting character for them.  

Once you have mastered both RP writing and characterization, the RP world
will be your proverbial oyster.

Text Normal getting around is down through cardinal directions, typing north,
east, south, west, up, down, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.  Or
n, e, s, w, u, d, ne, se, sw, nw.  

Some rooms you may not be able to get into, such as air rooms if you can't
super jump or fly, while others such as underwater rooms you'll only be able
to stay in for a short time if you can't breathe underwater.  

To get around the town faster you can hail a taxi, drive a car or
motorcycle, or get in the town trolley.  The town trolley is free to ride
and regularly stops at locations around town, just type board when it stops
near you, and disembark when it has arrived where you want to go.  

To hail a taxi type taxi list to see all the intersections taxis stop at,
then taxi (number) to travel to one, this is fairly quick but you will have
to pay for the ride.  Cars and motorcycles are used similarly but with the
commands drive (location) and ride (location) You can put the names of
passengers you wish to bring after the location such as drive 1 Bob Sue Jane
and as long as they are following you, they'll come also.  

If you want to move out of town you will need to use the travel command,
this can be used at the intersection nearest the bus depot in the
northwestern part of town.  To see a list of rooms you can go to type
roomlist, and then travel (number) to go there.  You can also use travel
car/motorcycle/plane (number) to use alternate methods to the bus, and bring
people with you by including their names afterwards in a list.  

To make rooms outside the town for people to travel to you'll use the
makeroom command.  

Traveling by plane is necessary for leaving the continent and much faster
than other methods, but costs a fair bit.  

You can type stall when using any sort of travel to pause where you are so
you can RP in your vehicle etc.  

You can use follow (person) to follow someone around, follow self will stop
following.

 Objects cannot be created from scratch in Haven. Instead, they must be bought
 from a shop. There are both player-run shops and NPC-run shops located in town.
 In order to customize an object, you must be in a room with a vendor who sells
 the same type of item, with the exception of thing, food or drink type objects.

 Objects must have a value of $.01 or greater when initially created, or, in the
 case of starting gear, customized. Although it is technically possible to 
 create a valuable object and price it extremely cheaply, many roleplayers will 
 treat an object which does not have a correct value assigned as a cheap, fake
 item. As Haven is set in a world very similar to our own, going by real life 
 prices is a good idea.
 
 There are several types of objects that cannot be customized and must be bought
 from the Hunt and Hook. These are ability-centric items such as bandages,

The gods were all once men a long, long time ago.  Men and women who became
so accomplished at the now lost art of fleshforming that they were able to
create for themselves new, perfect bodies.  Bodies that could not be
damaged, would never age or die, truly immortal.  As time passed and these
individuals continued to not age and grow stronger their influence became
all the greater.  Some humans began to worship on their own, others assumed
the identity of pre-created pagan deities.  

As their power and influence grew, different groups came more and more into
conflict and the world was half torn apart by the fighting between these
powerful beings.  Finally they met and settled on an accord of peace and
non-interference.  Creating for themselves their own pocket dimension in
which to retreat peacefully into, a realm called Asgard, Olympus or any one
of a number of other names.  From there they continued to have some limited
interaction with the human world, often venturing into it in disguise or
taking it upon themselves to help certain favored individuals but mostly
remained aloof and apart from it.  Masters of fleshforming they have filled
their world with various amazing and dreadful creatures, as well as
semi-human servants and vassals.  


Sometimes a god will sleep with a human while visiting the human world, at
times they do this while in the visage of another, such as the human's
lover, at other times they do not.  The reasons can be as varied as falling
in love with a human to a simple lark.  The chance of a god impregnating or
being impregnated by a human is low, about one tenth of the chance of a
human with a human but can happen.  These offspring and their descendants are
called demigods.

Similarly to the gods, the lords of the Fae were once humans who became
extremely accomplished in fleshforming magic.  Unlike the gods however they
had no interest in power, leadership or responsibility.  Rather they were
hedonists who used their power only for their own pleasure, rendering
themselves immortal but not entirely unkillable.  They very early on created
their own realm.  The Fae is a world that is forever caught up in a never
ending party, over the centuries however increasing boredom has led to
entertainments become more and more extreme and the lords of the Fae have
long since lost any sort of human empathy.  Entertainments vary from simple
stories and dance to brutal life or death contests and recreational torture.


The Fae sometimes journey into the human world, taking on any form they
chose when they do so, male, female, or animal.  Sometimes they do this in
order to capture people to bring back with them to serve in the Fae world
forever.  Those chosen in this way may end up simple entertainers, or
fighting for their life against brutal and monstrous creations.  Almost no
one ever escapes from Fae after they've been captured, and none at all
escape after they've been there for more than a week or two.  

Sometimes they journey out in order to play pranks on the humans, as a sort
of vacation.  These pranks also are very variable, some are incredibly mild,
and may even end up helping their target, such as arranging things so that a
homeless bum becomes a millionaire overnight.  Others can be incredibly
cruel.  The Fae are masters of manipulating fate, having given themselves a
natural magical ability to do so, sorcery that can intelligently manipulate
a thousand small variables to bring about a desired result, seemingly simply
as a result of luck.  

Every now and again the Fae will sleep with a human, this is rarely done for
simple pleasure however and never for anything as trite as love.  It is
almost always part of some prank, sleeping with a man in the form of his
wife when she is stuck in traffic and watching the ensuing argument.  Or
impregnating a young religious girl and wiping from her mind the sexual
encounters so she has no explanation for her pregnancy for her parents.  The
chance of impregnation is low, about one tenth the chance of a human
impregnating another but can happen.  These offspring and their descendants
are called faeborn.  

Fae are unnaturally sensitive to magnetic fields and can even be kept weak
and near incapacitated by those that are powerful enough.  Even their
decendants show some signs of this vulnerability, being made slightly dizzy
by strong fields and when struck with ferromagnetic weapons.

Text A demigod refers to anybody with divine ancestry.  Demigods usually
inherit some small degree of the perfection of their parents, they tend to
be more attractive, more physically capable, more resistant to disease and
injury, to heal quicker and age more slowly.  They often also tend to have a
psychological pre-disposition towards their god's aspects, the descendant of
a thunder god for instance may enjoy being out in storms.  

Demigods also may be favored by their divine parent, who might take it upon
themselves to aid in their life or set them to tasks they wish to see
accomplished.  They however possess no real supernatural abilities beyond
their innate remarkableness.  

In ancient times to be taken as a god's lover was a great privilege and the
gods bestowed a gift upon those they slept with, imbuing them with health
and longevity.  Some degree of this persists in their children.  After
having sex with a demigod a person will heal more rapidly for about two
days, as well as not aging or becoming sick in that period.  While this can
be a great gift from a demigod lover to their lover or spouse and even has
led to some demigod couples being effectively immortal rumors persist of
those who pay highly for captured demigods to use them forcibly in order to
stay young forever.  

Today demigod genes are erratic like other supernatural genes.  Usually
activating only once every three of four generations.  The chances of any of
your direct family also being an active demigod is astronomically small, but
it possible for a grandparent or great grandparent to be.  There's also a
decent chance that twins, both fraternal and identical will share the trait
if one has it.  

Demigods much like Faeborn, Angelborn, and Demonborn can be either latent,
passive or active.  

Latents are effectively entirely human, but there is a chance that at some
point in their adult lift the latent genes will activate and they will
become either active or passive.  Passives are mostly human but they have
some degree of the resistance to disease and aging and tend to be more
attractive and capable.  They also have the effects of prolonging the life
of their sexual partners.  

Actives are passives until around the end of puberty, usually seventeen to
nineteen, when they activate.  They also sometimes activate later in life,
although this is very rare in people not living near the Gate.  As well as
the effects of passive demigods actives also gain other amazing supernatural
powers.

This archetype represents people who have fallen out of their time in the
past and into ours.  They can be out somewhere, walking along peacefully
when they stumble into a hole in time.  To the rest of the world they simply
have vanished, fallen off the face of the earth.  But time shifts and at
some point in the future, maybe twenty years later, maybe two thousand years
later they will step right back into time again, without any knowledge that
any time has passed at all.  When making a timeswept character, make them
the age you want them to be normally.  If you'd like them to be 30, set the
birth year to 30 years ago, then use the timeswept command to input how many
years you wish for your character to have been out of time.  This will
automatically push your birth year back that many years, while making you
look and age the same.

The faeborn are those fae in their family line.  These fae genes activate
erratically, usually for one child in every three or four generations.  The
chances of any of your direct family being active faeborn is astronomically
small, but it is possible for a grandparent or great grandparent to do. 
There's also a decent chance that twins, both fraternal and identical will
share the trait if one has it.  

Faeborn tend to be smaller in stature than most humans, and have more
delicate, elfin like features.  They also tend to have a greater
predisposition towards mischief and often a bit less empathy for others
compared to most people.  The faeborn tend to attract extremes in luck,
being far more likely to for instance win the lottery, but also more likely
to be wrongfully imprisoned.  The faeborn's natural uncontrolled influence
on fate can sometimes be harnessed.  If a faeborn is captured and held
prisoner by any person in any way, that person will benefit from greatly
improved luck for the duration of the captivity.  The faeborn also won't
attract the same extremes in luck they normally would while held captive. 
There are three basic types of faeborn latent, active and passive.  

Latent Faeborn are effectively entirely human, but there is a chance that at
some point in their adult life the latent genes will activate and they will
become either active or passive faeborn.  

Passive Faeborn are almost entirely human, but they have the appearance of
faeborn attract the same extremes in luck and have a special type of blood
that's used in certain rituals.  

Active Faeborn are passives usually until around the end of puberty, usually
seventeen to nineteen, when they activate.  They also sometimes activate
later in life, although this is very, very rare in people not living near the
Gate.  As well as the effects of passive faeborns the Actives once they
activate have amazing and varied powers.  Often gaining supernatural
strength, magical abilities or shape shifting skills.

The demonborn are a disparate group, while some are indeed the descendants
of human and demon couplings these are very rare, far more common are humans
who were affected by demonic forces while still in the womb.  The result is
basically the same however, a human who is in some small part demon.  The
demonborn tend to be physically stronger and hardier than most humans, also
with a much higher tolerance for heat.  Many find themselves drawn to and
interested in fire as well.  The demonborn are also infected with the innate
demonic sadism.  They derive physical pleasure from the pain, discomfort or
unhappiness of others.  While this isn't enough to make all of them turn
into psychopaths it does turn a lot and others tend to settle into some
lifestyle or profession that allows them to get their fix.  They are
commonly found as dominatrixes or in pain oriented kinky relationships, or
in professions such as soldiers, police, criminals, or professional
fighters.  

The blood of the demonborn is a potent mystical chemical accelerant.  It
will augment any natural chemical reaction such as those of explosives.  A
drop of blood into the gunpowder of a bullet can double its penetrative
power, while a glass of it can make any bomb much more deadly.  

Today demonborn genes are erratic like other supernatural genes.  Usually
activating only once every three of four generations.  The chances of any of
your direct family also being active demonborn is astronomically small, but

Passive demonborns are mostly human but then tend to be a bit stronger and
hardier than most, have more tolerance for hot temperatures as well as
possessing the innate demonic sadism and the properties of their blood.  

Active demonborns are passives until around the end of puberty, usually
seventeen to nineteen, when they activate.  They also sometimes activate
later in life, although this is very rare in people not living near the

A long time ago, powerful flesh mages created the ultimate servants for
themselves.  They designed them to be beautiful, to have wings and the power
of flight for speedy transportation, and most importantly to be incredibly
supernatural empathic.  These beings would feel the wants, needs, pains and
dislikes of those around them more keenly than their own.  If you wanted a
message delivered, they wanted to deliver it, if you wanted your feet rubbed
they wanted to rub your feet.  They were the perfect servants, however
eventually the secret to creating them was lost and over time they died out.
Their descendants however, remain.  It's unclear if they were named Angels
because of their similarity to the biblical beings, or if indeed the
biblical beings were named Angels because of their similarity to them.  

Their descendants today are referred to as Angelborn, none today still have
wings or any remnants of them, but many like heights and dream of flying. 
They are also more attractive than most people and tend to live a little
longer.  Most importantly they still have some degree of the Angelic
empathy, while not nearly as strong, they still naturally want the same
things as those around them.  It works like a sort of unspoken peer
pressure, and draws them naturally to jobs and lifestyles that are more
selfless or service oriented.  It's common to find them working in charities
or as aid workers, or even as masseuse or prostitutes.  

The tears of the Angelborn can be used to make a sort of love potion.  If
someone swallows a shot glass or so worth of Angelborn tears they will be
infected by a powerful version of angelic empathy, focused on the first
person they become aware of.  For the next 5-6 days that person's wants and
desires will become their wants and desires and they'd do whatever they can
to fulfill them.  

Today angelborn genes are erratic like other supernatural genes.  Usually
activating only once every three of four generations.  The chances of any of
your direct family also being active angelborn is astronomically small, but
it possible for a grandparent or great grandparent to be.  There's also a
decent chance that twins, both fraternal and identical will share the trait
if one has it.  

Angelborn much like faeborn and demonborn can be either latent, passive or
active.  

Latents are effectively entirely human, but there is a chance that at some
point in their adult lift the latent genes will activate and they will
become either active or passive.  

Passive angelborns are mostly human, but they have the appearance of
angelborn and their supernatural empathy.  They also have a special type of
blood that's used in certain rituals.  

Active angelborns are passives until around the end of puberty, usually
seventeen to nineteen, when they activate.  They also sometimes activate
later in life, although this is very rare in people not living near the
Gate.  As well as the effects of passive angelborns actives also gain other
amazing supernatural powers.  

`WNote:`x Angelborns are physically entirely human in appearance.  

When they were first created angels were given a vulnerability to obsidian
in case their empathy ever failed at keeping them in line.  While this has
never truly been needed the vulnerability is still present to this day. 
Angels and their angelborn decendents become weakened whenever struck by
obsidian weapons and cannot break out of obsidian bonds or cages no matter
their preternatural strength.

Text Haven is a small town on the coast of Massachusetts, not far from Boston
and an easy commuting distance from Brown University.  To most of the world
that is all it is, and even to most of the residents its not so different. 
They have a few extra rules they live by, like dont venture out into the
forest alone and never go outside when its misty no matter what you hear. 
But apart from these they live much as anybody else does.  

For others though, for the members of the supernatural world Haven is
something entirely different.  It is a place where one can cross between the
worlds, a waystation and the last one of its kind on earth.  This makes it a
place of great import, where supernatural groups can use these connections
to gather valuable and powerful materials and goods from those other planes.
It is also where any threats from outside earth would first arrive, making
it an important fortress and beachhead should earth ever be attacked.  

For these reasons it drew the interest of the three most powerful
supernatural organizations in the world, The Hand, The Order and The Temple.
These organizations all shared a common goal in holding Haven as a defensive
bastion, but also are all in competition over the resources that can be
obtained from it.  Many attempts to strike an accord between them failed,
until finally they settled on a less diplomatic solution.  The three
factions came together to work a great magic over the town, called Sanctuary
this magic protects anybody inside the town from serious harm by others. 
And this protection is where the towns name derives, although not all are
equally protected and several ways to bypass the protection have since been
discovered.  The spell allowed the factions to compete and conflict with
each other, without ever being at risk of weakening the forces they have set
to guard the earth from intrusion. After WWII when the three factions faded
into history, the town continued to be fought over by secretive supernatural
societies, making use of it in a similar way.  

Others also found the town of interest, supernatural scholars and magical
practitioners came to experiment with the supernatural power to be found
there.  Others came to make use of sanctuary to hold conferences or shady
meetings with those they couldnt otherwise trust.  And the town drew the
attention of a criminal supernatural element as well. In Haven, with
sanctuary, enforcing supernatural law was almost impossible freeing up
certain types of criminals to do as they wished as long as they didn't need
to kill anyone.

When supernaturals fight, they usually do so in a shadow world, a darker
mimicry of our own called the nightmare.  There they can conflict freely,
without ever being seen or noticed by the normal members of humanity.

A manipulation of the spaces between worlds called pathing, allows some
supernaturals and those they take with them to travel vast distances very
quickly.  Due to the latent power of Haven pathing to and from it tends to
be a fair bit faster than elsewhere, and societies often deploy operatives
there for just that reason, wanting to take advantage of their ability to
quickly deploy to missions or conflicts around the globe.  

The Institute also set up a campus in Haven, offering impartial
services to other societies of training and containment their campus has
attracted a good deal of corporate interest to the out of the way town.

Text Vampires have existed for as long as anyone can remember. There are many
theories as to their origin, ranging from that they are a type of demon to
cursed souls.
 
Vampires are immortal, or, rather, immune to death by disease or old age.
Their bodies are unlike typical humans, requiring blood in order to keep
their muscles working. Although they don't have a beating heart, blood
suffuses their entire form in an almost sentient manner. Maintaining this
requires the vampire to feed normally once or twice a week.
 
`cFeeding`g:`w
 Most vampires feed from humans once or twice a week to maintain a typical
 level of activity. Very active vampires, particularly vampires who fight
 a lot, are likely to feed twice as much, while inactive vampires can feed
 much less.
 
 Many vampires have an innate talent with `Whypnotism`w, allowing them to
 place prospective prey in a trance state to feed. The human is left with
 no memory of the incident, at most feeling a recent rush of vertigo.
 
 Most vampires will kill about one person a year from feeding. This is not
 usually intentional, but a side effect of picking a target who has a weak
 heart, high level of blood toxicity, thin blood or who has recently lost
 blood. Regardless of how careful a vampire may be, it is impossible to
 prevent occasionally killing someone so long as a vampire feeds on humans.

 See `Whelp bite`w for information on feeding on PCs.
 
`cVampire Blood`g:`w
 Also known by street names such as V, Juice, Red and Hype. 
 See `Whelp vampire blood`w.
 
`cTurning`g:`w
 New vampires are made by an existing vampire feeding on his target, then
 feeding the target some of his own blood. Mechanically, this can be done
 by using the `Wforce change`w command on a helpless target.
 
 Turning does not directly affect a new vampire's psychology. However,
 the combination of access to power and the hunger that drives vampires
 to occasionally kill do cause changes. Some newly turned vampires cannot
 adapt and end up killing themselves, but this is rare. Most do adapt,
 with world views ranging from balancing out their deeds with good works,
 to the belief that it is their right to be natural predators or monsters.
 
 Characters who are already dead, including ghosts and wights, cannot be
 turned.
 
`cDeath`g:`w
 Vampires can die if they take enough physical damage. Vampires who are
 killed disintegrate into ash.
 
`cStaking`g:`w
 See `Whelp stake`w.
 
`cSunlight`g:`w
 Vampires are nocturnal creatures. They do not combust with exposure to
 sunlight, but do find it extremely unpleasant. Sunlight is very bright
 and painful to them, and is blinding without protection. Exposure to
 direct sunlight burns them in a manner similar to a sunburn, but much
 more quickly, particularly at midday.
 
 Some vampires can develop a resistance to sunlight, and a rare few are
 predisposed to it. However, even if they are resistant, the noon sun is
 still extremely painful to them.
 
`cReflected and Reproduced Images`g:`w
 Vampires do produce reflections, but these reflections are unnatural. A
 brief glance may not discern anything unusual, but prolonged exposure to
 a vampire's reflection first causes an uneasy feeling that gradually will
 intensify to the point it can cause insanity. Even the vampires themselves
 are not immune to this, causing them to use mirrors very sparingly.
 
 This effect happens with all images that may be considered live, with the
 vampire in the same room. Filming a vampire live or taking a picture which
 involves a digital screen will cause this effect. Flat images (photograph
 prints and portraits) and previously taken video or video not broadcasted
 in the same room will not cause this effect.
 
`cUrban Legends`g:`w
 Vampires are not repelled by garlic, but find the smell unpleasant. They
 are not affected by religious symbols or holy water.
 
`cSlumber`g:`w
 Vampires feel the urge to sleep during the day, which feels more or less
 the same as typical tiredness. However, regardless of whether the vampire
 has chosen to sleep during the day, all tiredness washes away with sunset.
 
`cFatigue`g:`w
 Vampires do not experience typical fatigue from physical exertion. Instead,
 they get hungry. Blood for them is similar to fuel for a car, and the more
 they exert themselves, the more hungry they feel, until they top up.
 
`cPhysiology and Aging`g:`w
 All vampire fluids are tinged with blood, including tears and saliva.
 
 Vampires can reactivate their physiology with some concentration. Only by
 doing this may they mimic typical human physiology in a limited form,
 allowing them to digest large amounts of food and drink or engage in
 sexual activity.
 
 This reactivation can be emotionally driven, but such concentration does
 require being awake. Theoretically, a female vampire can reactivate her
 body to the point she is able to carry a child for nine months, but the
 effort would require her not ever sleeping. Male vampires can impregnante
 a living female with much less effort, though it would still require some
 concentration to do. Sexual activities are the most common cause for
 vampire activation.
 
 Reactivating their physiology causes vampires to age while active. Their
 day to day business may require activation, though vampires are able to
 activate parts of their body at a time. Typically, it will take about
100 years to visibly age 1 year, although this can be reduced by refraining
 from activation.
 
 `C`gNote`g:`w Reactivation is not a coded mechanic, but entirely roleplayed.
 
`cFood, Drink and Drugs`g:`w
 Vampires can imbibe small amounts of food and drink without problems. To
 consume large amounts, they must reactivate their physiology. Drugs taken
 by typical means do affect vampires, but at a very reduced rate (roughly
 a third of the rate they would affect a human). Drugs consumed by feeding
 on blood affect vampires the way regular consumption affects humans.

Text There are many types of magic in the world, only a few are very well
documented.  

`WSorcery`x
Basically sorcery consists of drawing on a source of energy and directing
and shaping it.  What this source of energy is exactly is unclear, it's
pretty well known that it is extra dimensional however.  It's often called
simply 'The source' or 'The Ocean' some believe it's an ocean of energy on
some other world, others believe it's some kind of god.  

Opening a way to this energy allows it to flood through, opening the way
further, it can then be transformed into other forms of energy and directed
as the wielder wishes.  

Humans are not usually capable of this type of magic.

`WRituals`x
Rituals are a type of magic that can be performed by almost anyone.  All
they require is access to the proper instructions which every society
library should have.  They also require specific ingredients however, in
particular they require human blood.  

It's believed that rituals function by draining a form of energy from this
blood, which is then fed through the ritual to spirits who carry out the
request.  Exactly what these spirits are or where they come from is unclear.


`WGate Magic`x
Gate Magic is another type of ritual, and again anyone with access to a
society library should be able to perform it.  However it doesn't invoke
spirits or take blood, rather it draws power from the Gate to enact it's
effects, most usually those effects are related to the Gate itself, such as
opening bridges to other worlds.  A benevolent practitioner could use it to
end a drought through making a bridge to the plane of water, while a
malicious one could flood the world with a similar bridge.  Luckily gate
magic takes some time to perform and is usually detectable by seers so it's
unlikely anybody could end the world without people noticing and trying to
stop them.

Text `WAlso Read:`x Help Werewolf Mechanics.  `x

Werewolves have been around for as long as humans, they are made whenever a
werewolf bites a human while in non human form, the bite must pierce the
skin. Not all bites are infectious, usually the more severe the bite the
more likely it will infect if the victim survives. Werewolves who wish to make
another usually will bite the same place repeatedly. Cauterizing wounds soon after
being bitten usually prevents infection.

Werewolves can transform at will into very large wolf shapes, larger than a man
and twice the size of a natural wolf.

Werewolves are much stronger than humans, they also regenerate quickly from
wounds and have heightened senses of smell.  They are at home in nature,
enjoying the smell and feel of the natural world, by contrast highly
artificial smells and environments make them uncomfortable, such as smog or
cigarette smoke.  

`WWerewolves and the moon`x
Werewolves transformations aren't entirely linked to the moon, they can
change at any time.  However they are much weaker during the new moon.  Also
during the full moon werewolves are subject to a condition known as Lunacy. 

Lunacy is a kind of rage or insanity that sets upon werewolves during the
full moon, it makes them anger extremely quickly and be very prone to
violence, some even hallucinate during it.  It's very common for werewolves
to transform during this time and rampage, and a full nine tenths of new
werewolves are bitten on the full moon from werewolves under the influence
of Lunacy. Werewolves who can resist changing for 2-4 months are able
to partially resist lunacy and are much less likely to end up killing
people during it.

`WThe change`x
The change takes about a month and begins gradually, the new wolf's senses
first begin to develop, then strength and healing abilities.  The ability to
transform tends to come quite late in the month, and many don't realize they
can transform until their first full moon.  

`WWerewolves and silver`x
Silver causes itchiness and rashes to werewolves that wear it for prolonged
periods, additionally silvered weapons are liable to cause temporary
in werewolves struck by them.

`WWerewolves and magic`x
Werewolves are close to nature and have an intrinsic sense of what is an is
not natural, as well as a dislike for unnatural things.  While technically
werewolves could perform magic it causes a strong unpleasant feeling
whenever it's performed, most believe that this feeling is nature crying out
against it and are strong proponents of it stopping being used.  

`WWerewolves and vampires`x
Werewolves are the embodiment of natural world, vampires of the unnatural
and there has always existed a degree of antipathy between them.  Vampires
and werewolves find each other's presence unpleasant, this doesn't preclude
some from becoming friends or getting along, it is akin to a person having
bad BO.  Unpleasant to be around, but not debilitating.  Again many
Werewolves believe this is nature telling them that the vampires should be
destroyed.  

`WWerewolves and death`x
Upon dying a werewolf will turn back into their human form, this isn't
instant however and normally takes about an hour.  

`WWerewolf pregnancies`x
Werewolves can get pregnant just like normal humans, there is a chance the
child will be born a werewolf.  Having a werewolf mother gives about a fifty
percent chance for the child to be a werewolf, a werewolf father about a ten
percent chance.  Werewolves can transform and are subject to lunacy at any
age, even as infants, although changing is usually beyond their control
until around the age of ten.  Because of this even werewolves who want wolf
children usually prefer to have a human child and turn them once they're old
enough.  Children born werewolves almost invariably have to be hidden from
the world until they reach an age where they can control themselves.  

`WWerewolf Hide`x
The skin of a transformed werewolf is a prized possession, garments made from
werewolf furs or tanned werewolf leather are extremely tough, wind
resistant, yet light and supple.  Most werewolves can smell when a piece of
clothing is made from their skin and it's normal for those who wear it to be
targeted for vengeance by the pack.  Because of the werewolf's
transformation upon death, the hide must be harvested very quickly or even
in some cases, while they are still alive.  

`WWerewolf Psychology`x
Werewolves are mostly mentally unchanged from the humans they were before,
except that they tend to have a tendency towards anger, violence and group
socializing.  These tendencies aren't so profound as to change their
underlying nature however.  

Some werewolves go primal, embracing the Lunacy.  Most try to control
themselves during that time, or lock themselves up.  Werewolves psychology
tends to shift towards very naturalist world views, they tend to oppose
industrialization and many have been linked to eco terrorist groups.  
 
`WWerewolf Combat`x
Werewolves are generally considered the most powerful soldiers amongst
the supernaturally gifted, a combination of that and how easily
they can create more if the need presents itself leads to them
being the most sought out mercenaries in the supernatural world.

Text Cars and motorcycles help you get around Haven.  To obtain a car you need
to use the garage command, see help garage for more information.  

Vehicles may be of one or two types, and of five different quality levels. 
Vehicles of two types cost twice as much to obtain the same level of
quality.  Each type conveys different bonuses. These quality levels are
seen as junker, economy, standard, high and excellent quality.

Vehicles are paid for every week, the default value is 0.5% of the
vehicle's value, but those with multiple vehicles garaged may pay less for
their extra ones if they aren't being loaned out, with the discount
increasing based on the owner's wealth stat.  

Once you have a vehicle you can use it with the drive or ride commands, and
can use park to stop your vehicle prematurely, drive slow to slow down, or
stall to pause in your travel where you currently are.  

Vehicles have to be driven from the point they were last driven to, if the
vehicle is new or their location is invalid for some reason they can be
driven from any intersection.  

Vehicles have stashes inside them accessible from their last driven to
location.  

Damaged vehicles repair automatically, but are unavailable until they are
repaired fully.

Characters who hide in the same room as their vehicle will gain a stealth
bonus to represent their stake out.  
 
`cTypes`x

Safe: Less likely to have an accident when driving in the mist, less
likely to be injured when attacked or in an accident.
Excellent Bonus: Impossible to have an accident when driving slow in the mist.

Sport: Does more damage when running into pedestrians and other vehicles.
Excellent Bonus: Moves around the grid at approximately double speed.

Luxury: Gives influence bonuses to the owner when the active vehicle.
Excellent Bonus: Gives an attractiveness boost when the active vehicle.

Van: Can store more passengers.
Excellent Bonus: Stealth bonus when hiding in a room with the van doubled.

Tough: Less likely to be forced into an accident when attacked.
Excellent Bonus: Bulletproof.

Sportsbike: Quality levels cheaper
Excellent Bonus: Moves around the grid at approximately double speed.

Cruiser: Quality levels cheaper

Text Demons are biological weapons, fashioned a long time ago by wizards in an
attempt to win a war.  They now run that world, which is called hell.  There
are billions of demons in hell and more are regularly being made.  Hell is
run by a group of archdemons, believed to be about twelve.  These are
unbelievably powerful sorcerer demons and are responsible for running hell
as well as creating most of the other types of demons.  

Several of the upper echelons of demons, including archdemons, can influence
earth, they have the ability to reach their magic across to affect things. 
They use this power to make things worse where they can and often to improve
the life of those who agree to do their bidding on earth.  

When they were first created demons were given a vulnerability to quartz in
order to make controlling them easier.  While this ultimately failed they
and their decendants still have this weakness today.  Even powerful demons
may be incapacitated by a quartz stake through the chest and demonborn all
become weakened when struck by quartz weapons.

Text `WSyntax:`xAward (player) (reason)

Award is an SR command that gives the target a bonus to their ability to
earn karma up to a certain point.  SRs earn awards to give out as they
engage in SR activities and this is tracked over their account.  

A reason has to be given and that shows to any other SRs online as well as
to any staff and is logged.  Award is in place to reward people for
particularly good RP, using it to try and simply help out yourself or your
friends may get your ability to SR removed.

When used by a Story Runner this command gives them information about the

information but also echoes to the player that you've obtained it, at trust
2 it gives not information to the player.  

When used by a PC this command gives an anonymous request to the player to
demonstrate a discipline or stat.  It might be used after someone has done
something in RP that would require a stat people are unsure they have, while
you don't have to use showstat after someone probed you, failure to do so
might be considered poor RP practice.

   required to raise a discipline to a particular level.
 
Disciplines are the stats used to determine your combat performance, and are
broken down into three categories: Melee, Ranged, and Defensive.
 
The combined total of all your defensive disciplines is added and multiplied
by 5 to give your overall defense value, which works similar to hit points.
 
Melee Disciplines can only be used when next to a target, with a distance 
value of 1, and do their value in damage.
 
Ranged Disciplines each have a unique max range and an optimum range which 
is half that. Each of the help files for the ranged disciplines lists these 
but this decreases towards 0 at max range or when the target is adjacent.
values. They do the same damage as a melee discipline at optimum range,
 
Certain disciplines require specific weapon objects in order for them to
count as being effective. For instance, the Rifle discipline will require
a large gun object. `cSee Also`g: `WHelp Object Types`w
 
The melee disciplines of Striking and Grappling will add to your total melee
effective value. These do not stack. For instance, if you have 10 Striking
and 20 Short Blades, your effective Short Blades if you have the weapon will
be 30 Short Blades.

While people know of the supernatural it remains hidden, avoid

Make sure you're dressed, it's a good idea when you get the

Text As a Story Runner there are three basic types of RP you might get involved
in.  The first is personalized RP, this is when either because you were
asked or on your own initiative you decide to get involved in someone's
personal story, to play NPCs from their history or related to their current
position.  It's a pretty cool way to make character's histories matter and
make their actions feel like they have consequences.
 
The second is general room scenes, where you just pop into a room, get your
votes and start doing your thing.  There are several uses for this sort of
RP, namely ambience, realism, introductions and excitement.
 
Ambience means simply emoting for NPCs and background activity to make the
world feel more alive and real for the players.  While often overlooked it
can do a lot to help players feeling of immersion.  Ambience can often be
added to from outside the room if you have enough trust to spy on people and
send them messages.
 
Realism is similar to ambience but refers to making the situation reflect
the reality of the inferno world.  For instance this is a world where this
is a lot of paranoid, hostility and fear about supernaturals.  Those who're
open about being supernatural should meet that fear and hostility.  They
might be refused service, avoided, asked to leave, subject to harassment. 
It might even go so far as to lead to them be attacked by hunters or similar
individuals who happen to be nearby.
 
Other things might be people walking around carrying weapons only, or doing
drugs in the middle of a public place.  Anything that really breaks the
theme and reality of the game you can be there to have the world react as it
should to those events.  Again his is a very important task to helping make
the game world feel like a real place.
 
Introductions are when you create a situation which will push players
together and give them reasons to get to know each other and interact. 
Causing some sort of crises or problem in which they work together could be
one instance, or simply causing events to reveal something about one
character.  Good players should find reasons to get to know each other
themselves, but it never hurts to give them a cool how we met story.
 
Excitement refers to livening things up, it can be anything from an argument
to a demonic attack, while the forces of hell are out there and are usually
exciting.  More human excitement is also an important part of the setting
and shouldn't be neglected.  A RP scene involving a fire spreading through a
building and tasking players to escape the flames and rescue others can be
incredibly gripping.  Exciting RP should involve some sort of challenge for
the players to overcome, a challenge that they have a legitimate chance of
failing.
 
The third type of RP is of course stories.  Stories are usually a bit more
elaborate and have a bit more of a set up to them.  All stories should
involve contact stats in some way and preference should always be given to
those with contact stats.  This is the purpose of those stats, to know about
things going on and it's unfair to players who've spent points in them if
they don't get an edge in getting involved.  The best way to start a story
event or organize them is generally with the calendar.
 
Stories are built out of challenges, a simple one might have a single
challenge like beat this monster.  A more elaborate one might have a
sequence of challenges or even branches.  An example might be a story which
involves a group having to penetrate the defenses of a facility to kill the
evil vampire who runs it.  This may branch depending on the group's
strategy, if they choose stealth it may lead to different challenges and
story arc than if they go in all guns blazing.
 
All challenges should have a real chance at failure, why does this matter? 
It's important for the drama of a scene that players feel like they *might*
fail, it's that which makes their successes sweet and gets them involved in
what they're doing.  Without the chance for failure, success is meaningless.
And in order to make players feel like they might fail, sometimes it has to
actually happen.  Additionally players should feel like their choices
matter, if any choice I make which isn't completely stupid will lead to the
same result, those choices don't have much impact anymore.
 
That said, there are different types of failure, failure and success don't
have to be hard, they can also be soft.  A soft failure is one that allows
the player to continue and proceed but at increased cost.  It might take
more time, hurt their char or their pride, cost them money or other
resources etc.
 
To return to the example of the players trying to get inside a secure
facility, they choose to attack the main gates.  You know this isn't going
to work, they haven't scouted well enough to know but the facility has a
small army inside it.  Rather than have them be killed or driven off and
unable to get inside however, a hard failure.  You opt to have them be
capture, and locked up in the basement.  The players then after some time
break out of their cell and are now inside the facility and able to progress
to the next stage, heading for the boss.  However they're injured, it took
longer and they should feel a bit silly about themselves for getting
captured.  This is a soft fail.
 
The culmination of the story probably should use a hard fail option, but
soft fails can be invaluable in the lead up to that climax.  Allowing the
player's choices to matter, but still ensuring they make it more or less
through the whole story.
 
Soft successes are another option that is very useful, say my players get to
the evil vampire and try to kill him, but I don't want him to die yet
because I have plans for other stuff he's going to do down the line. 
Instead of them just failing to kill him, which is basically a fail, I can
use a soft success.  For instance he gets away but he's injured and his
facility gets destroyed, saving dozens of people.  In this way the player's
successes are still rewarded, while allowing me to have my villain escape.
 
Mastering soft failures and successes is often the key to achieving a
balance between narrative and realism that provides the most enjoyable and
gripping experiences.
 
So now you've got through that the question becomes, what are you going to
make your story about, so I will go over a brief, non-exhaustive, list of
haven antagonists.
 
Firstly, groups interested in the gate.  Various groups and
individuals are interested in using Haven's proximity to other worlds.  Some
are doomsday cults looking to bring about the end of days, others sense an
advantage to be had.  These groups are after all the reason the societies
watch over Haven.
 
Secondly, supernatural hunters.  Hunters are a very varied group, some are
ex temple or military, some are just random people who decided to hunt
monsters, many are from religious extremist groups of many different
denominations, others have had those close to them killed by the
supernatural or even just hunt them for sport.  Hunters are a constant
problem for supernaturals, because the law almost never will protect them
from them, they also can be a big problem for others as many of them are
inexact in their targeting practices, it's not that uncommon for a human
Goth to be killed by someone thinking they were a vampire.
 
Thirdly, the supernaturals.  All supernaturals have a dark side, vampires
invariably kill the odd victims, werewolves often escape and kill during
lunacy, and that's aside from those who just go rogue.  Werewolves who
embrace their primal savagery, vampires who kill for enjoyment, mages who
experiment on people or use their magic to do crime.  Shifters who join
savage packs, demonborn giving in to their urges, faeborn working an
angle...  Aside from rogue members many of the societies may come to blows or
be drawn into conflict through the actions of their members.
 
Fourth, bad humans.  There's no rule saying only supernaturals can go bad,
and no reason why players might not want to get involved using their special
knowledge and abilities to help stop a perfectly mundane serial killer or
bank robber.
 
Fifth, fae and gods.  The gods don't generally act as antagonists but they
are essentially still human so they may.  The fae are often interested in
playing pranks or cruel tricks on people in the world and can make excellent
antagonists.
 
Sixth, demons.  The greatest threat from demons is that of the archdemons. 
Archdemons are incredibly powerful beings and while trapped in hell they
have enough power to reach across the gap and influence things in our world.
Archdemons almost always work through vassals.  Humans or supernaturals with
whom they've struck a bargain, it's within their power to manipulate the
world enough to make someone rich, to make the head cheerleader fall in love
with them, to cure them of illness, make them immortal or powerful.  In
exchange they obtain a link with which they can witness the world and snuff
out the life of their vassal at their whim.
 
Vassals are usually empowered by the archdemons, usually with sorcerous
abilities as well as other lost talents like fleshforming.  They may be
given powerful abilities to influence the minds of others, to use
destructive magic or to fleshform monsters or loyal foot soldiers, usually
using animals as templates.
 
Every archdemon, like all other demons cares only for causing death,
destruction and misery, and the tasks they set their vassals to are always
to further these ends.  They may be straight forward like building a bomb or
unleashing a army of fleshformed monster soldiers, or more subtle like
becoming involved in human trafficking, force prostitution, or just running
a company that forces it's employees to work 14 hour days.
 
The ways in which vassals operate is as varied as can be, but their motives
are always evil in service to their archdemon.  Finding/stopping, and
eliminating vassals is one of the most important tasks that players might
have to do in order to protect the world.
 
All six of these antagonists are important and a mixture of all five is
crucial to a good RP environment.  It may be tempting to make everything
about the demon threat but by doing that you're doing your players a
disservice, inferno is a whole world, living and breathing.  Enemies are not
always external and clearly distinguishable as good or bad, terrestrial and
morally complex threats also exist, and it's by dealing with all of those
that players get to live in this world.

It is possible in haven to take enemies prisoner instead of simply killing
them, when a PC has run out of defense a melee range attack can be used with
attack (person) knockout or simply knockout (person).  This attack has a 1
in three chance of success and will knock the target out for half an hour. 

While knocked out the target can be tied up with the bind command which will
permanently lock them into a helpless state until someone else unties them. 

When someone is helpless, either through being bound or unconscious they can
be moved around regardless of their permission by using drag or carry
commands, or in the case of traveling or cars by including their name after
the destination.  

They also cannot move around on their own, or communicate with their phone. 
Several other commands also become usable on them.  

Execute will kill a captive.  

Wound will let you inflict a certain level of wound on your target, you can
also add a message that will appear when people look at them until that
wound has healed.
 
Mark will let you put a temporary message that will appear when people
look at them for a while afterwards.
 
Force will allow you to do other things such as change their clothes or
appearance, rob them or turn them into a vampire/werewolf.
 
Abduct can be used in a room where a player has logged off and if successful
will bring their unconscious body back into the game where it can be
interacted with.  See help abduct.

the character dies.  If additional factors = 2, it's a critical wound.  
If additional factors = 1, it's a severe wound.
 
The scaling factors are:
 
 `c*`w A random 10 percent chance.
 `c*`w A 50 percent chance if the character is forcing their own abortion.
 `c*`w If the target is wounded already.

Text `WSyntax:`x compete against (person) with (stat) and (stat) and (stat)

This command allows you to test your stats against someone else?s, up to
three at a time.

For instance if you wished to arm wrestle with someone, compete against (person)
with strength

Would test your strength against theirs, or for a game of darts you might
enter compete against (person) with games and dexterity

On completion of the command it will send an echo to the room of who won.

Normally the winner will always be the person with the highest stat total,
if the stat totals are equal it will be a fifty/fifty chance. However
this may change based on the inclusion of certain stats.

Currently games is the only stat which deviates from this, when adding
games as one of the stats tested it will always introduce an element of
randomness to the calculation while still significantly favoring the
person with higher stats.

For each 1 point below the other person you are in a game calculation, your
chance of winning will lower by a multiplicative 20%. So if stat levels
are the same you'll have 50% chance, if you're one lower 40%, if 2 lower
32% etc.

As optional syntax you can also drop the 'against' and simply type compete
(person) with (stats)

Text There are many unexplained phenomena in the world, one of the most
prevalent is people developing unusual abilities.  

The abilities have little pattern to them but it has been noticed that
genetic relations seems to play at least some part, having a parent or grandparent with a supernatural gift markedly increases the likelihood of a child
having it, although the chances are still incredibly low.  

Supernatural creatures also often acquire a variety of paranormal abilities as
they develop.  This is much more common than humans developing them,
particularly with associated gifts.  

Prolonged exposure to the gate seems to increase the chances for developing
a paranormal gift as well.  Overall the development of each supernatural
creature is distinct, while several core traits usually stay the same they
then branch off into many distinct developments.  In the case of vampires
and werewolves the one who turned the person usually has an impact on their
development.  

Humans who possess some paranormal gift are also more likely to develop
others, although it's unclear if this is natural or because of their greater
exposure to other supernatural elements caused by the pre-existing gift.  

Certain abilities can cause concern or hostility amongst others, werewolves
who develop common vampire abilities are often thought poorly of amongst
their group and humans with paranormal gifts are often mistrusted by normal
humans or The Temple.  

Supernaturals who develop similar abilities and traits often tend to
cluster, either simply because of their commonality or because of a belief
that they are similar for a reason, sharing a bloodline or being blessed by
a particular spirit etc.
