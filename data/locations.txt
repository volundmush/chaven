Timeline Fri Nov 10 2023: Conspiracy theorist blogs are filled with scattered reports emerging from New York, indicating that unidentified, kevlar-clad operatives arriving in black vans are methodically apprehending and "black-bagging" individuals suspected of affiliations with the Vampire Court. Across the boroughs, there are accounts of individuals, ranging from local politicians to members of the homeless community, having been abducted by these assailants. With the uncertainty surrounding the Vampire Court's influence in the financial and political realms of the city, New York's supernatural community finds itself in a precarious atmosphere, with many acknowledging that the city has become a focal point of contention.
Tue Nov 14 2023: Under the coercive influence of the Templars, bolstered by manipulated and potentially fabricated photographs depicting New York politicians in compromising situations, the state legislature has reluctantly approved the expansion of Bellevue Hospital's cancer wing. Regrettably, this seemingly benevolent initiative masks a more dubious agenda, as the new cancer ward has been repurposed by Templar operatives for the chipping and processing of local supernaturals, facilitating their tracking and control. This development poses a significant threat to the supernatural community in New York.
Mon Nov 27 2023: The Temple confronts the remnants of the desperate Vampire Court of New York, disparate supernatural elements, and reinforcements from the formidable Vampire Empire. They strategically demolish the abandoned building that served as a coordination hub for these rebellious forces. Exploiting the ensuing chaos as a diversion, the Temple successfully establishes a strategic presence on Floor 56 of the Tyrell Corporation's skyscraper. Simultaneously, they eliminate the final stronghold of supernatural resistance. With these actions, the Temple asserts its control over the city, commanding the local government, its first responders, and influential figures on Wall Street.~

Timeline Sat Dec  2 2023: Negotiations unfolded within the walls of Haven's town hall as the Temple orchestrated a strategic agreement with the Witch Hunters. The exchange involved a nuanced barter encompassing critical information, clandestine trading routes of the black market, sources of aftermarket weapons smugglers, and various other clandestine transactions. In return for this trove of invaluable resources, a pact was forged between the Templars and the Witch Hunters. In the aftermath of this accord, the Templars pledged their support to the Witch Hunters in their relentless pursuit of a common adversary: the Coven. Executing a meticulously planned operation in the sprawling Sherrin Woods, a reported haven for the Coven's routine rituals, the Temple successfully absconded with a pivotal Coven grimoire. This artifact, held in high esteem by the Coven, was promptly delivered into the hands of the Witch Hunters. Having fulfilled the terms of the agreement, the Witch Hunters reciprocated by furnishing the Temple with valuable local contacts and an initial staging area within the region. However, an unintended consequence emerged from the zealous nature of the Witch Hunters. Their fervent pursuit of magic practitioners in Boston has cast a shadow of uncertainty in the city, leaving every arcanist in the region apprehensive about an impending visit from these fervently magic-averse enforcers. Consequently, supernatural tensions in the area have been heightened, further complicating the delicate balance of power.~

Basecore 6 Nestled within a nondescript apartment building in the heart of Minsk, The Order has established a discreet haven. It is an apartment that conceals its supernatural secrets behind an unassuming facade. This clandestine dwelling serves as the perfect covert base and is a sanctuary of secrecy amid the bustling urban landscape. Blending in seamlessly with its neighbors, the unremarkable hideout is guarded by an inconspicuous door, and offers no indication of the mystical enclave concealed beyond. Inside, there is an armory that holds weaponry and protected relics, a meditation nook, and a library full of books and scrolls in an invaluable repository for knowledge.

The Kingdom of Nar's borders stretch to the southern parts of Gharrek, but are cut short by the expanse of the Empire, which rules the rest of the territory. The People have a few tribes here and there, but many of them are relocated to camps and other places, out of the Imperial Dynasty's sight and mind.

The pirates of Navvere are generally hunted by the Imperial Fleet, though they have a lot of luck raiding Nar's ships. Some sailors tell of a continent further east, one with a kingdom that rivals the Illarin Empire in power; Imperial officials see this as propoganda and generally silence these rumors where-ever they can.

Refugees are found in all directions, trying to escape the violence, some of which even making their way into Haven in their desperation to escape. Whispers speak of plans for the Hand to establish complete control over the region, something that would be a humanitarian disaster for the locals.`x
Thu Dec 21 2023: `088The Hand`240 has successfully fought off a final, desperate attempt from the local Fae of `yThe Crossroads`240 to stop them from building their `238O`240b`242s`244i`247d`248i`249a`249n`248 `247T`244o`242w`240e`238r`240. Now it looms over the region, cementing `088Starkcreek`240's reign of terror and standing as a symbol of the coming age of oppression. Locals have been arrested left and right for even the smallest crimes, a crackdown of all enemies of the Hand and the tyrannical loanshark-gone-commander both. Whispers between collaborators suggest regret with the increasingly oppressive decrees - now, however, far too late.~

Pillars of ferromagnetic iron, like spikes facing outwards around the Tower, serve to encourage the Fae to give a wide berth. An affront to the realms of mirth and games, a single glance is all it takes to remind one of the oppressive terror that comes with the regime of `088The Hand`244.
~
Plant `088Cytris Starcreek`240 was never quite a 'good' egg. A brutal loanshark guarded by notoriously sadistic goons, she would bail residents of the Crossroads out of debt at humongous rates of interest. When inevitably they would be unable to pay their weekly toll to her, an offer would be made. A single game of chance, a game of Cytris' choice, where victory would earn them a stay from their debt, whilst a loss would doom them to a life as her slave. Refusal meant physical violence until acceptance - or until they died from their wounds.`x
 
`240Even for the Fae, her games were not within the realm of acceptance. Insidious and cruel, they often boiled down to torturing their own loved ones, the winner being whomever would cause them to pass out from shock, pain and stress. In some cases, there were hunts instead, the targets tied down and made to crawl like dogs through the forest, away from the cruel Fae. Hideously stacked in Cytris' favor, the locals tired of her cruelty, her extortion and the accruing debts of dubious consent (or, had it been earth, legality). She was chased out of the Crossroads, forced to hide on Earth. Here, she found an employer in `088the Hand`240, who used her ruthless demeanor to intimidate and extort hostile businesses and inconvenient academics.`x
 
`240Now, she has returned, backed by muscles augmented and trained by Hand Peacekeepers, under the firm control of the shadowy organization. Declared `088Supreme Commander`240 of the local watch, her reign of terror and intimidation strikes fear into the hearts of the local Fae. It is said she will not cease until all are in her iron grasp, ever fearful of her choosing them next for her callous games, heart pounding at every knock on their doors, secret codes and knocks invented by some in a futile attempt to hide from her, pretend they're not home for any others. Each decree sent to her by the Hand, finds itself executed with sadistic glee.`x
~
Plant `062Undertown is a small community that lives in the caves deep below the forests of Lauriea. Lit by bioluminescent plants the community is home to all manner of individuals and creatures as well as frequently used by smugglers and those on the run from the Fae.`x

#LOCATION
Name Celestriana~
Continent 8
Lockout 1570445412
Status 1
Notes A rocky, mountainous land to the west of Lauriea Celestriana is known for
being difficult to survive in particularly at night when its worst predators
emerge.  Only the hardiest of communities survive there, and it's a place
sought by those looking for solitude.
