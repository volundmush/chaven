Name The Order~
Eidilon ~
EidilonType 0
EidilonPlayers ~
Description This group is made up of a blend of supernaturals and naturals who
believe that supernatural abilities are a gift that should be used to help
others.  While simple in theory in practice debates about the best way to
help others plague the Order and can cause some to believe they have little
direction or impact.  

Members of the Order however are unified in their desire to help people and
make the world a better place.  Many of them are true and selfless heroes,
although it must be said that glory hounds are often found in their ranks
too.  Most of the supernaturals in their number are either new to their
power or possess incredible mental discipline to over the slide into
corruption.

Manifesto The Order simply wants to make the world a better and more equal place
with less poverty, disease, death, misery, inequality and pain.  They try
and prevent others from causing these problems by rehabilitation or finding
ways to weaken or impair their ability to do so, detainment, Venetian oaths,
weakening curses etc.  

Order governments tend to operate out of houses, changing which one they use
semi-regularly.  They are formed of a small council of elder who make their
decisions.  Order governments are very strict with long law books formed for
governing their areas.  Generally speaking if something is illegal in the
mundane world, it's supernatural equivalent is illegal as well, using
supernatural abilities to gamble, or get favourable deals and so on are even
crimes, although relatively mild ones.  While the most officious of the
factions, they're also often the most willing to be of aid if you have a
good cause.  

If someone is accused of breaking the law, they are given a full trial with
an Order judge and a jury of random supernaturals.  Putting this trial
together however can sometimes take months and it's not uncommon for people
to be detained longer awaiting trial, than they would have if found guilty. 
Their punishments are typically fines or time in specially designed prisons.

History After the Gods and Fae left earth behind, some of their former students
and acolytes formed several supernatural councils.  A druidic council in the
northwest of Europe was initially a small time player in the supernatural
world but eventually grew into a powerful player called The Order who saw to
the destruction of the Western Roman Empire.  

Throughout the medieval period they controlled most of Central Europe.  The
Industrial revolution led to the decline of the power of the supernatural
and after World War Two the Order was left shattered, broken up into a dozen
smaller fragments which rose and fell over the following decades.  One year
after the supposed defeat of Et-Aral however several in the supernatural
community started advocating for greater cohesion, the need to return to
larger, more powerful groups to safeguard the world and The Order began to
regather its strength.  
~
Roles Shieldbearers are the largest military group with The Order and are
responsible for the protection of others.  

The Shieldbearers are tasked with handling all the Order's defense and siege
work.  Usually deploying in practical street wear, but with a signature coat
or jacket to identify themselves(typically brown) they tend to use heavy
armor and favor emplaced heavy weaponry.  They tend to prefer to pick areas
of high value or impact and then set up defenses and emplaced weaponry in
that area to ensure it stays with the Order.  They are vulnerable however to
being caught while moving locations.  They often take round ballistic
shields with them into battle, using them to cover each other when needed,
or placing them along walls to help fortify an area against weapons fire,
they are usually called 'girls' by the other factions.  

Swordbearers are a smaller group with the Order, dedicated to proactive
efforts to deal with threats before the shieldbearers may be needed.  

The Swordbearers are the most mobile of the divisions, they tend to favor
fairly light armor and weapons such as pistols and submachine guns.  Usually
deploying in practical street wear, but with a signature coat or jacket to
identify themselves(typically brown) they are also the most melee focused of
the divisions and generally try to use their mobility to close and or flank
the enemies before tearing into them in close quarters combat.  Swordbearers
are often called 'dogs' by the other factions.  

Librarians are the support and investigative arm of the Order, and those
who're less focused on conflict than on research and finding ways to improve
the world through the occult.

Name The Hand~
Eidilon ~
EidilonType 0
EidilonPlayers ~
Description This group is made up almost entirely of supernaturals, they believe that
humankind has proven to be weak, unreliable, short sighted and stupid and
that the world would be a better place if they ran it.  To this end the
group has many political connections and is a powerful force behind the
scenes, manipulating governments and companies using their supernatural
gifts to their own ends.  They tend to see supernaturals as superior because
of their gifts, and wiser because of their longer life spans and thus more
suited to rule, while humans are considered a lesser class.  
~
Outcast 0
Manifesto The Hand wishes to implement corporate like meritocracies in which the
superior rule over the inferior, with the superior almost always being those
who are supernatural and also card-carrying members of the Hand.  In such a
society the use of supernatural abilities is never a crime, simply a natural
expression of an individual's merits.  

Hand governments tend to use corporate guises, with the leader being the CEO
of some cover company and their advisors being the board of directors.  They
are usually located within some unusually well guarded corporate building
near the center of the city.  Hand governments are very relaxed in general
and encourage their people to deal with their own problems.  They only
intervene in the case of serious crimes, such as serious assaults and
murders.  They typically don't police crimes against humans unless the crime
could call attention to the supernatural world, or is otherwise bad for
their interests.  A crime against a human who belongs to another super is
considered a crime against that super however, but the government would only
get involved if it was of the serious assault or murder level.  They are
generally easy to get permission to do things from, but difficult to obtain
help from.  

If someone is accused of breaking the law, an investigation is carried out
by an inquisitor with some mind control abilities.  If found guilty their
punishments usually involve brainwashing the guilty into being some new,
productive member of society.  You can be found innocent of any crime in a
Hand court if you can successful argue that what you did was for the greater
good.  In theory this is the greater good of the world, but in practice
often blurs more into the greater good of the Hand.  
~
Missions Creating and cultivating human assets for The Hand.  

Using Mind Control, drugs, addiction, financial or social pressure,
coercion, blackmail or bribery to turn individuals into assets for The Hand
willing to spy on their neighbours, provide intelligence, provide blood, or
help to blackmail/coerce new assets, or provide assistance through their
workplace, or through laundering resources or helping in social
manipulation.  

Manipulating conversations and social environments to promote Hand friendly
positions, such as meritocratic over democratic ideals, individual freedoms
and in supernaturally aware society, the inability of humans to self-govern
and the natural right of supernaturals to use their abilities whenever they
wish.  

Spreading domination of the financial world by controlling business owners
or other financially significant individuals, owning businesses and banks. 


Spreading domination of the political world by controlling voters,
government officials and politicians.  

Spreading domination of the media by controlling bloggers, social media
accounts, journalists and media companies.  

Convincing enemies to defect to the Hand.  

Using punishment/reward incentives to train humans or low esteem co-workers
into being better, more obedient and more useful to The Hand.  

Punishing those who try to stand up to The Hand or otherwise resist its
inevitable world domination.  
~
History When the Gods left earth, the resulting power vacuum was filled by their
former servants forming independent and competing councils.  One of the
earliest and strongest of these was known as the Council of Rome.  This was
where the first vampires developed as a way to extend the lives and power of
the council members.  They waged war against the Israelites and then the
Christians until Christianity was adopted by the Roman State, at which point
the group became more covert and started to call themselves Manus, or The
Hand.  

Through most of the Medieval era The Hand controlled primarily Italy and
England as well as some Eastern European states and warred with the Temple
and The Order.  The industrial revolution began a decline in the power of
supernaturals but the Hand was still able to exert significant control over
much of the new world including Australia and many of the economic
powerhouses of the US.  

World War Two broke the power of the Hand, the increasing complexity and
secrecy of global conflict with the rise of the Cold War was an anathema to
the large organizations and they splintered apart into several smaller
groups.  One year after the supposed defeat of Et-Aral however several in
the supernatural community started advocating for greater cohesion, the need
to return to larger, more powerful groups to safeguard the world and The
Hand began to regather its strength.  
~
Roles The Peacekeepers are the Hand's soldiers, guards and police.  Called upon
whenever martial might is required.  

The Peacekeepers tend to deploy in modern black military gear and are
usually well armored.  One of their favorite tactics is to use slightly
curved, rectangular shields and deploy into what they call the phalanx. 
This involves a squad of troops, the first line crouching and planting
shields, the second line placing their shields on top and firearms and
sometimes the occasional flamethrower being pushed through special slots in
the shield to allow the peacekeepers to fire.  It presents a front that is
effectively immune to small arms fire, but is somewhat slow to move or
maneuver and can be vulnerable to flanking attacks.  The defense can also be
penetrated by heavy weaponry, amongst other societies they are often called
'turtles' for their use of this tactic.  

The Shadows are the Hand's covert operatives, responsible for
assassinations, espionage, spying, research, R&D and arcane support.  

The Shadows tend to deploy in lightly armed and armored black military gear,
or enemy/civilian outfits.  They are particularly fond of espionage and
assassination in open conflict, but also fulfill much of the sniping,
scouting or support roles for the Hand.  Due to their dark garb and the high
number of vampires normally found in them, they are often called 'Bats' by
other societies.  

The Whisperers are the Hand's public face, they are it's diplomats, PR
agents, advertising executives, and politicians.  Dedicated to influencing
the world at large to serve the agenda of the Hand as well as handling
relations with other groups.  Those groups might be supernaturals ones, or
natural ones relating to the Hand through one of their many corporate
fronts, the largest and well known of which is Coretech Industries.  
~
Scenes Discovering the identity of Hand assets.  

Trying to free Hand assets from the control of the Hand.  

Trying to convince Hand operatives to defect.  

Arguing against the Hand's moral codes.  

Offering yourself as a Hand asset for personal benefit or to save someone
else.  

Seducing or befriending a Hand operative to attempt to spy on them and
discover useful intelligence.

Name The Temple~
Eidilon ~
EidilonType 0
EidilonPlayers ~
Description This group is made of mostly non supernaturals, they believe that magic
and supernatural forces are inherently damaging and should be removed
entirely from the world.  Most of their members are essentially supernatural
hunters or soldiers, religiosity is also very common.  Some of their members
are extremely prejudiced, going so far as to hate all supernaturals,
believing they are evil abominations who must all be destroyed.  Some
however are very compassionate, believing that being supernatural is not
that person's fault, they deserve all the respect and kindness of anyone
else, but still thinking that the world would be better served if
supernaturals and their influence could be grandfathered out.
~
Outcast 0
Manifesto The Temple works to minimize or eliminate supernatural power on Earth.
They oppose anyone becoming supernatural or growing in supernatural strength
and try to limit when and how people can use supernatural power,
particularly when using it for ill-ends.  In the mainstream Temple killing
of supernaturals is reserved only for those who do great harm and can't
otherwise be stopped, but there are more radical subgroups.

Temple governments operate out of bunkers that they build under some house
or other building that they own, warehouses are popular choices.  They have
a strict chain of command, with a Commanding Officer who makes the decisions
and others after that.  Their laws with regards to supernaturals are
reasonable lax, only getting involved in more serious offenses, such as
serious theft, assault, murder and so on.  They are however significantly
more diligent about crimes against humans by supernaturals, and almost any
use of supernatural abilities against a human in a way that's negative for
the human is likely an offense.  They sit somewhere between the other two
with regards to how willing they are to give permission or help, usually
operating from a ruthlessly pragmatic perspective.

If someone is accused of breaking the law, they are subjected to a tribunal
of three Temple officers to decide their case.  They usually prefer corporal
punishment, whippings, sometimes the loss of a hand or executions in serious
matters.

History The Temple first formed out of Israelite warriors in Canaan around 1400
BCE as a group dedicated to fighting against supernatural evils.  While
constantly persecuted and often seemingly crushed throughout history they
always managed to spring back and reform growing in strength as they started
to join with the newly burgeoning religion of Christianity and finally
pushing the Hand back when Christianity was adopted as the state religion of
Rome.

The Temple's influence grew slowly over time, being accelerated by
technological and industrial developments but they were pulled into the
great conflict of World War Two and were shattered into countless smaller
groups in the aftermath.  One year after the supposed defeat of Et-Aral
however several in the supernatural community started advocating for greater
cohesion, the need to return to larger, more powerful groups to safeguard
the world and The Temple began to regather its strength.
~
Roles The Strike Force is one of the most elite military groups in the world,
and they have to be in order to contend with supernatural threats without
supernatural powers of their own.

The Strike force prefers ambushes and sniping to open conflict, they are
almost always looking to take the high ground and hold their shots for the
right opportunity to make the biggest impact, usually targeting officers
first.  They most often deploy in modern military camouflage.  When sniping
isn't a viable option they prefer to set ambushes with land mines or razor
wire.  They are usually called 'mosquitos' by the other factions.

Intelligence are the eyes, ears and brain of the Temple, consisting largely
of ex-intelligence agents and military intelligence officers.

Temple Intelligence tend to deploy in slightly modified civilian garb and
provide support, scouting, and espionage during times of conflict.  They
particularly like to sneak in to place remote detonated explosives on key
enemy assets, and detonate them right when the enemy most wanted to use
them.  They have a pronounced rivalry with the Hand's Shadows.  They are
usually called 'geeks' by the other factions.

Demolishers are known as the Temple's wrecking ball for when all subtly has
gone out the window.  Consisting of most of the Temple's supernatural
members as well as others wielding dangerous experimental weaponry.

The Demolishers usually deploy with the heaviest weaponry and in stripped
down military gear, with men often going topless.  They aren't usually that
well armored and carry such heavy weaponry as to render their mobility
limited.  In a direct firefire they rarely lose, but tend to perform poorly
in confined areas.  Amongst other factions they are generally known as
'freaks.  '

Corrupt or enslave Temple assets or militia members.

SoldierName a kevlar-clad Templar operative~
SoldierDesc Cloaked in a full black Kevlar suit that provides a formidable blend of protection and mobility, this Templar operative is armed and ready. The identity of the wearer remains mostly concealed, thanks to the protective gear and a concealed helmet that shields their face. Adorning their equipment is the distinct emblem of a stylized sun, a prominent symbol of their allegiance to the Temple's cause. At their disposal, this operative carries a highly customized variant of an AR-15, the sleek design of which hinting at cutting-edge technology. The rifle is finely tuned for precision and lethality, boasting features like a modular rail system and a holographic sight for quick target acquisition. Holstered at their side is a high-caliber Desert Eagle sidearm, a reliable and compact companion for close-quarter engagements against supernatural threats.  For melee encounters, the operative wields a retractable baton with a reinforced polymer construction. With a combination of advanced weaponry and stealthy armor, this Kevlar-clad Templar is a force to be reckoned with in the shadows of their operations, be they overt or covert.

Name The Sapphire Martyrs~
Eidilon ~

EidilonPlayers ~
Description The Sapphire Martyrs believe that nothing can be done to prevent the destruction
of Earth but if the other worlds are still connected to it when its end comes,
they too will perish. As such they are trying to achieve enough domination over
the world to destroy it before its destined demise so as to sever those
connections and save the other worlds.

Their ranks are filled with individuals who have lost hope in salvation and are
ready to embrace oblivion, believing in the purity of their cause. Their ideology
is steeped in a profound sense of martyrdom, and they view their mission as a
tragic but necessary act of love. Despite the horror of their objective, they
carry themselves with a chilling serenity, seeing beauty in the sacrifice
they are prepared to make.~

Description The Golden Shadow is a mercenary group that has chosen to profit
from the world's impending destruction rather than try to prevent it. They
are opportunists, working with whoever offers the most gain, be it dark
forces or desperate individuals. Their ideology is one of ruthless pragmatism;
they believe that in a world destined for destruction, the only sensible
course of action is to amass as much wealth and power as possible while they
can. They are skilled fighters and negotiators, using their talents to
exploit the fear and chaos that the approaching apocalypse has caused.~

Description The Black Flame is a cult that worships the eldritch horrors of the
void, seeing them not as bringing about a necessary end. They believe that the
world's destruction is not only inevitable, but desirable, a cleansing fire
that will pave the way for whatever comes next. Their members are drawn from
all walks of life, united by a shared fascination with the unknown and a desire
to prepare the world for its impending end. They conduct rituals designed to
hasten the arrival of the eldritch horrors, and work to spread their beliefs,
hoping to convert others to their cause. Despite their dark and seemingly
nihilistic ideology, they see themselves as the world's saviors, guiding it
towards its ultimate destiny.~
