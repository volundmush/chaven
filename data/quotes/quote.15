"Life has no meaning any more does it? The wine has no taste, the
food sickens you, there seems no reason for any of it, does there?
But what if I could give it back to you. Pluck out the pain, and
give you another life, one you could never imagine, and it would be
for all time. And sickness and death could never touch you again.
Don't be afraid, I'm going to give you the choice, I, never, had."
