"Here was neither peace, nor rest, nor a moment's safety. All was
confusion and action, and every moment life and limb were in peril.
There was imperative need to be constantly alert, for these dogs
and men were not town dogs and men. They were savages, all of them,
who knew no law but the law of club and fang."
	-Jack London
